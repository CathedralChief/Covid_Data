The following principles have guided our prioritization of approaches for reopening campus to University of Arizona students, staff, and faculty:

Equitable outcomes for all students, staff, and faculty regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or their need to refrain from in-person activities due to concerns about COVID-19.

Rapid identification and isolation of COVID-19 case clusters in University of Arizona communities.

On-campus and off-campus self-quarantine options and wraparound wellness services for students, staff, and faculty with confirmed COVID-19 infection.

Protection of individuals in our University of Arizona community, and their family members, who are vulnerable to severe COVID-19 disease, or to harassment or discrimination.

Commitment to transparent and participatory decision making with regard to reopening University of Arizona campuses with clear and consistent communication protocols.

Vigilance in regular review and updating of approaches according to a rapidly emerging evidence base with active monitoring by key advisors from across University of Arizona colleges and support units.

Minimizing Exposure on Campus
Minimizing exposure to coronavirus is key to protecting UArizona students, faculty and staff from COVID-19.
We accomplish this by following the hierarchy of controls. 

ELIMINATION

Reduce the hazard

Examples:

At least 50% reduction of students in classrooms
Hybrid course offerings and staggered schedules for face-to-face instruction
Online option always available for high-risk students

ENGINEERING CONTROLS

Separate from the source of exposure

Examples:

Improved air filtration in HVAC systems
Increased fresh air mix in building ventilation wherever feasible
ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS

Change interactions and environment

Examples:

Frequent classroom cleaning (5 days/week)
Modified traffic flows and one-way paths within buildings
EPA-approved disinfectant and hand sanitizer
Revised classroom and building occupancy 

PERSONAL CONTROLS

Protect yourself and the community

Examples:

Do not come to campus if sick
Wear face coverings as required in classrooms, buildings and outdoor areas of campus
Stay at least 6 feet from other people
Wash hands frequently or use hand sanitizer
Practice good hygiene and disinfect surfaces
