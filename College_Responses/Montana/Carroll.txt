Quarantine/Isolation Plan for Summer and Fall

Carroll College has developed a plan to keep the Carroll community as safe as possible. The following information articulates expectations and guidance for Carroll College community members related to COVID-19. Updated expectations and guidance will be provided as information and protocols are developed.

The Carroll College community will engage in precautionary prevention measures to reduce the spread of infection. Such measures include:

    Wash hands OFTEN with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
    Avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth
    Clean living/working areas with household disinfectants, especially phones and commonly touched surfaces
    Use an alcohol-based (60-95% alcohol concentrate) hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available
    Avoid close contact with people who are sick, and stay over 6 feet away from others;
    Cover mouth and nose with a tissue or sleeve (not hands) when coughing or sneezing, then wash hands
    Eliminate or decrease contact with others and STAY HOME if you begin to feel sick
    Drink plenty of fluid, normally about 72 ounces per day
    Stay active, eat nutritiously and get good sleep

Each member of the Carroll College community should take responsibility in prevention by regularly wiping down commonly touched surfaces, including doorknobs, and engaging in the practice of social distancing, even when one is not sick.

    Definitions
        Self-isolation - Involves students and employees (hereafter “Carroll College community member”) isolating themselves from other community members due to symptoms of COVID-19, including fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Such isolation is achieved, for example, by ill students not attending classes or dining in communal spaces; or by employees not reporting to work on campus. Carroll College community members are encouraged to engage in self-isolation if they are experiencing a fever with either a cough or shortness of breath. Self-isolation should continue until a community member has been asymptomatic for at least 24 hours without the use of anti-fever medication.
        Isolation - Involves a mandatory separation of ill Carroll College community members from other community members. For the purpose of the COVID-19 plan, isolation will likely be required of individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19. Isolation will be required of Carroll College community members whenever such intervention is recommended to the community member by Public Health authorities. Criteria may involve symptoms and exposure. Carroll College community members will be required to remain in isolation for the duration recommended by Public Health.
        Quarantine - Involves mandatory separation of Carroll College community members from other community members because they have been contacted by Public Health authorities as having ben in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. For the purpose of the COVID-19 plan, quarantine also will likely be required of individuals who have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and have been tested, and are awaiting the results of the test. Quarantine will be required of Carroll College community members whenever such intervention is recommended to the community member by Public Health authorities. Criteria may involve symptoms and exposure. Carroll College community members will be required to remain in quarantine for the duration recommended by Public Health.
        Self-Quarantine - Involves isolating Carroll College community members who are well, but who may have been exposed to the virus. Self-Quarantine will be required of Carroll College community members whenever such intervention is recommended to or required by Public Health authorities. Criteria may involve symptoms and exposure. Carroll College community members will be required to remain in quarantine for the duration recommended by Public Health. In addition, any Carroll College community member traveling to the United States from a country classified at Level 3 by the Centers for Disease Control(link is external) will be required to adhere to the following:
            Engage in self-quarantine off campus for a period of 10 days from their date of departure from the affected area, and
            Notify Carroll College of their travel at least 72 hours prior to their return to campus. Employees should notify their Supervisor, while students should notify the Wellness Center. Should individuals engaging in self-quarantine become ill with fever, cough or shortness of breath, they may be required to engage in isolation.
            Social Distancing - Involves remaining out of congregate settings, avoiding mass gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet) from others when possible, and wearing a face covering when distance cannot be kept.
             
    Reporting Illness - Carroll College community members who are engaging in isolation or quarantine at the direction of Public Health officials must notify the College as follow:
        Students must notify the Wellness Center; Residential Students must also notify the Residential Life and Housing (RLH) Senior Staff on Call at 406.459.0540. They must notify their faculty of their need to be absent from face-to-face classes and work with faculty to make arrangements for participating in classes remotely for a period of time.
        Employees must notify their Supervisor and Human Resources.
         
    Triage Information Relevant for Students - The defining symptoms of COVID-19 are a fever AND cough or shortness of breath. Students who are experiencing either of these symptoms should call the Wellness Center at 406.447.5441. In order to reduce the risk of transmission of disease to other students, students should not, as a first step, come into the Wellness Center in person. Wellness Center staff will triage and assess patients over the phone. Students who are beyond the scope of our Wellness Center to treat will be assisted in accessing a higher level of assessment and care through referral to Urgent Care or a local care provider.
     
    Self-Isolation for Students - All students who are engaging in self-isolation should report symptoms to the Wellness Center. Students should also e-mail their professor to alert the faculty member of their absence. Students who expect to miss three days or more of classes and need assistance in communicating with faculty should contact the Saints Success Center. Students living on campus will be provided with a Wellness Kit to support their isolation. When students are assessed by the Wellness Center staff or other health professionals as needed to engage in self-isolation, the following will apply:
        All students will be provided counsel about their options, including the possibility of returning home to be with family during their period of isolation. Each case is different and guidance will be provided through Public Health and/or the Wellness Center.
        Students who live off-campus will be provided with instruction and counsel about how to engage in self-isolation.
        For students who live on campus, the Wellness Center staff will:
            Review best practices for self-isolation.
            Notify Residential Life and Housing if the student has not already done so.
            With the student’s permission, notify Sodexo staff and the Saints Success Center, in order to ensure the student receives meals and academic support.
            Provide students with a Wellness Kit that includes tissues, hand sanitizer, disposable thermometers, anti-fever medication, and an isolation mask.
        All students will receive instruction to contact the Wellness Center staff should their symptoms worsen.
         
    Provision for Food Service - Sodexo staff will prepare meal boxes (three meals/day) for all students in self-isolation, isolation, or quarantine who live on campus. Food preference and a meal request form will be provided to allow students to inform Sodexo of food needs, preferences, and any allergies/accommodations. To ensure that this option is only utilized by those who have the need, the food preference and a meal request form will be sent to students by Residential Life and Housing (RLH) after the student or the Wellness Center has notified RLH of the student’s need.
     
    Academic Adjustments - If necessary, the Saints Success Center staff will contact students in self-isolation, isolation, and quarantine to review options for continuing their schoolwork. Students should send a Faculty Notification to their instructors and advisor(s), notifying them of their current situation. For questions regarding academic support, students can contact the Saints Success Center by calling 406.447.5532 or emailing awalstad@carroll.edu. Students may also schedule appointments through Handshake. Phone appointments will be available for students who are in self-isolation, isolation, and quarantine – students should select the appropriate appointment type.
     
    Ongoing Monitoring of Impacted Students - Residential Life &amp; Housing staff will retain a roster of students who are known to be engaging in self-isolation, isolation, and quarantine. If an emergency response is required to those students, responding staff will wear masks and other protective equipment. Whenever Residential Life &amp; Housing or Campus Security staff are aware of an emergency response by external first responders to such a student, Carroll College staff will inform the external first responders of the student’s status in self-isolation, isolation or quarantine.

    Housing and Meal Service Plan for Impacted Students - Three areas have been identified for isolation and quarantine of resident students:
        The former ANZ house on Lyndale Avenue
        Several campus apartments
        St. Mary side of Guadalupe Hall for men
         
    At this time, it is anticipated that these areas will not have students living in them, so will be available when the Crisis Management Team determines there is a need. Students who are placed in isolation or under quarantine by Public Health officials will be assigned a room in one of the three locations. The following steps will be taken:
        The Wellness Center will notify Residential Life &amp; Housing of the student’s status and need for a room.
        Residential Life and Housing staff will identify a room for assignment and create a temporary access card for the student. The temporary access card will be provided to the student by the RLH Senior Staff on Call.
        Students will receive an information sheet that provides instructions and guidance for the isolation or quarantine period.
        Residential Life &amp; Housing will send the student a food preference and meal request form to request meals during the isolation or quarantine period.
        The assignment will be noted on a shared google sheet between the Wellness Center,
        Residential Life &amp; Housing, and Facilities.
        The student will complete a food preference and information form to receive meals for the duration of their isolation or quarantine period.
        The RLH Senior Staff on Call will be notified by Sodexo on a daily basis when meals are ready to be delivered. The RLH Senior Staff on Call may request assistance in delivering meals. All meals will be delivered by being placed outside of the door to the room; staff delivering the meals will place the meal(s) outside the door of the student’s room. After leaving the hallway, the RLH staff member will call or text the student notifying them that their meals have arrived.
        When the isolation or quarantine period has expired, the student will complete an electronic check-out form. The temporary access card will be placed on the dresser in the room.
        Once the check-out form is received, Residential Life &amp; Housing will notify Facilities and Housekeeping so that the room may be cleaned, disinfected and reset in case it is needed by another student.
        Once the room has been cleaned and disinfected, Facilities will update the google sheet, indicating that the room is ready to be used. Residential Life &amp; Housing will resupply the room with appropriate items.

        If there is an emergency, call 911 first, then notify Campus Security or Residential Life and Housing.

In the event that you need to reach out for support, notify one of the support lines above and provide your location and that you are in self-isolation, isolation, or quarantine. Share your reason for reaching out and the nature of the emergency. Carroll staff will respond as appropriate to the reason or emergency for which you are calling.

    Meals - Meals will be provided by Sodexo/Dining Services if requested. Residential Life and Housing will provide a request form that needs to be submitted as soon as possible to ensure that Sodexo is able to accommodate requests. Sodexo will notify Residential Life and Housing when meals are ready, and Residential Life and Housing will deliver the meal(s) to the hall once per day; bringing nutritionally balanced breakfast, lunch and dinner options. Bottles of water and a supply of fruit and snacks are provided in each room for student consumption. During self-isolation, isolation, or quarantine individuals will be cautioned NOT to order food from restaurants, GrubHub, UberEats, or other food delivery services. They should not ask friends, family, or anyone to bring them food directly. Self-isolation, isolation, and/or quarantine means they are to restrict contact with others.
     
    What to do in the event of an emergency? - In the event of an emergency, call 911 and inform them of where you are staying and then state your emergency. After speaking with dispatch, if you are able, call Campus Security to notify the Carroll staff of your emergency and that 911 has already been contacted. Upon the arrival of Carroll College staff, see “Entry into Your Space by Carroll College Staff” for instructions on what you are to do when others are entering the space.
     
    Entry into Your Space by Carroll College Staff - Individuals in self-isolation, isolation, or quarantine are not permitted to have guests or visitors or to leave the space (except for medical support). If support is needed, and a Carroll College staff member must enter your space, you must place a provided medical mask over your nose and mouth before opening the door.
     
    Cleaning and Other Supplies - General Supplies have been provided for your stay. These include tissues, bathroom tissue, trash bags, hand soap.  Cleaning supplies have also been provided in the room. These include paper towels and disinfectant spray.   Use disinfectant spray to clean all hard surfaces on a daily basis, specifically, high use surfaces (counters, doorknobs, bathroom surfaces, sink faucets, etc.)  If you run out of cleaning products or need additional supplies during your time within self-isolation, isolation, or quarantine, contact Residential Life & Housing by calling 406.459.0540.
     
    Requesting and Receiving Supplies - If you need supplies or personal items beyond what has been provided for you or what you brought into self-isolation, isolation, or quarantine, please contact Residential Life and Housing by calling 406.459.0540 and a senior staff member can assist you in locating needed items. If Carroll College is able to provide any supplies for you, items will be delivered to your door. After items are left at the entrance to your room, the person delivering items will contact you by phone via call or text message once they leave the building. You may then collect your items from outside your door. To restrict contact with others, do NOT ask friends, family, or others to bring supplies to you. In the event, you need to arrange for items to be delivered to you from friends/family, contact Residential Life and Housing first for specific instructions to coordinate delivery.
     
    Trash Removal - A trash receptacle and liners have been provided for you within the room. Use the trash receptacle for all waste, including used cleaning supplies, ensuring that the trash is thrown away inside of the black liners.

Fall Semester Contingencies for Orientation

Students will be placed in cohorts in early summer, with an Orientation Leader assigned to each cohort. Orientation Leaders will facilitate Zoom meetings to foster connections among new students. The College will shift content for large group orientation sessions to Moodle and make these sessions available during the summer months. Small group activities will be hosted on campus, keeping students in cohorts based off of State guidelines.  This cohort will be consistent for the duration of the orientation program. Other changes will include the following:

    Meals/Dining Services - staggered meal times and use of outdoor venues.
    The Orientation schedule will be shortened due to much of the content being shared virtually.
    We will plan for staggered move-in times for new students and returning students across multiple days.

Travel has proven to increase your chances of contracting and spreading COVID-19, due to the close contact most travel involves.  To be prudent, and to follow state and local travel restrictions, the following protocols have been implemented for travel:
Phase 1

No employee or student business-related travel will be allowed through this phase.  If an employee takes personal leave and travels out-of-state or abroad, the employee must self-quarantine for 14 days immediately upon returning to Montana per State directive.  All employee personal leave must be reviewed and approved by the President.  Students considering leaving campus for an out-of-state trip may not return to campus unless circumstances are extenuating.  If an exception is granted, the student must self-quarantine for 14 days immediately upon returning to Montana per State directive.
Phase 2

All employee or student business-related travel will be minimized through this phase. College sponsored international travel is still suspended at this time. Essential business-related travel will be reviewed on an individual basis by the employee’s supervisor or department chair.

    Requests for Essential Business-Related Travel - Must be approved by the responsible Vice President or Division Head.  Approval will be based upon:
        The capacity to adhere to CDC travel guidelines and local Public Health recommendations at the destination;
        An assessment of the need for the requested travel during the semester instead of at some later time;
        The immediate importance of the requested travel to the College’s core mission; and
        The potential long-term consequences to the College of not undertaking the requested travel during the semester.
    Definitions of Essential Business-Related Domestic Travel
        For Faculty – Travel is considered essential if it is required to preserve a research project or activity that cannot be postponed. Travel to participate in a professional or educational conference is defined as non-essential and has been suspended through this phase. Faculty seeking approval to engage in business-related essential travel through the use of College funds, should submit a request to the VP of Academic Affairs who will make the final determination.
        For Staff – Travel is considered essential if the lack of in-person attendance would have a significant, adverse impact to the operations of the College. Travel to participate in professional development activities is considered non-essential and has been suspended through this phase.  Staff seeking approval to engage in business-related essential travel through College fund, should work with their supervisor and submit a request to the responsible Vice President or Division Head who will make a final determination.
        Course-Related Travel – Field trips for course-related purposes are allowed if it is deemed essential to the core educational purpose of a course. Travel should be approved by a request to the VP of Academic Affair’s office that includes a description of the educational value of the trip, a description of how physical-distancing guidelines will be met, and if there are students taking the course remotely, a description of how those students will be able to participate or what alternate assignment might be offered to the remote students.

Carroll College is committed to providing a quality education in-person this fall. The semester will look a bit different compared to years past, with social distancing measures, a shortened fall semester and other mitigation measures designed to keep the campus community safe.
Fall Semester

To ensure student academic success and minimize risk to all, the plan includes the following:

    In-person classes on campus will commence with an early start date of August 17, 2020.
    Fall Break will be eliminated to ensure completion of all courses, including finals, before Thanksgiving by November 25, 2020.  Labor Day on September 7, 2020 will be observed as a class holiday.
    Implement social distancing, healthy hygiene and cleaning protocols.
    Cleaning supplies will be provided in each classroom to be used as follows:
        At the end of each class, students and faculty will be expected to spray down desks, chairs, tables, teaching stations and technology in each classroom.
        At the beginning of each class, students and faculty will be expected to wipe down desks, chairs, tables, teaching stations and technology in each classroom.
    Students and faculty are required to wear face coverings in all classrooms while in class and labs until further notice (additional precautions may be required in labs).
    Classes will be scheduled in classrooms to achieve 50% of room capacity by one of the following measures:
        Moving small classes to larger spaces.
        Splitting larger classes into two sections.
        Identifying overflow spaces, where two rooms can be reached simultaneously with video technology.
        Removing furniture from overcrowded rooms and taping off chairs in stadium seating lecture halls.
        Alternating in-person classes/labs to limit number of students in one space using technology to supplement with a hybrid modality.
    Academic technology will assist faculty to leverage technology in their teaching modalities.
    Will deliver a limited number of fully remote/on-line courses based upon student and faculty needs.
    Faculty will hold office hours and meet with advisees whether teaching in-person or remotely.  Their office hours and contact information can be found on the course syllabi and in Moodle.
    Disciplines requiring laboratory/experiential learning will develop safety protocols/training and deploy simulation opportunities if appropriate.
    Departments requiring community-based placements (i.e. nursing clinical, student teaching, internships) will ensure that sites adhere to safety, health and social distancing protocols and that students receive appropriate orientation and training before placement.
    Performing Arts courses and programs:
        Vocal and wind instrument ensembles and performances will be suspended until it can be determined that students can safely engage in these activities.
        Choir courses offered for academic credit will continue to be offered utilizing simulated digital options.
        String ensemble will be offered and conducted adhering to institutional requirements for health, safety and sanitation in the classroom.
        Theater will only select shows with ability and permission to livestream in lieu of live performances.
        A decision will be made by July 1, 2020 regarding the possibility of postponing the fall musical to 2021.
        Rehearsals will be conducted adhering to social distancing protocols, including the use of face coverings and other protective gear.

Global Education

To ensure the safety of all, the following guidelines will apply:

    International degree seeking and exchange students will be allowed to enroll in fall classes provided they have been issued a visa and comply with all Federal and State regulations for entering the country.
    Preliminary planning for faculty-led study abroad programs may take place over the summer. However, the college will make a final decision no later than September 15, 2020 as to whether or not the program will take place over the winter break based upon the status of the pandemic and feasibility of traveling safely.
    Carroll students who seek to study abroad for the 2020-2021 academic year will be advised regarding the risks associated with traveling internationally during the pandemic. Academic departments will make suitable alternative arrangements or substitutions for students enrolled in majors that require a study abroad experience should they choose not to travel prior to degree completion in May of 2021.

While the College is committed to having classes in person this August, Carroll is prepared to move to remote delivery should we be faced with a second outbreak of COVID-19 and a return to Phase 1.  
Training

To ensure our faculty, staff and students are prepared to mobilize any plan, the following training has been or will be provided.

Training for Faculty

    Mandatory 1-Week Training: Future-proofing Every Course: This training is for all Carroll faculty and is designed to establish some standard practices for course design and delivery that will position us as a College to deliver instruction at a distance on short notice. It will also improve the student experience by creating a more uniform application of Moodle.
    Fundamentals of On-line Teaching (Optional): This training is mandatory for faculty that wish to teach fully asynchronous courses, meaning any course which does not have regularly scheduled meeting times. It covers the basics of asynchronous teaching with a strong focus on building and leveraging a social presence in the on-line learning space.
    Advanced On-line Teaching: Communities of Practice (Optional): This training is for faculty that have already taken the Fundamentals of On-line Teaching course. Rather than a traditional course, this is a guided collaboration between practicing faculty to augment their on-line teaching skills.

Training for Faculty/Staff/Students

    Video training on appropriate health and safety protocols, i.e. wellness checks, wearing PPE, social distancing, sneezing/coughing etiquette, handwashing, etc.
    Training for students on remote learning expectations, tips for success when learning remotely, and academic integrity.

Student Academic Support Services

The Saints Success Center offers a number of academic support services including academic advising, testing, career services, placement and accessibility resources.  These services will be provided either in-person implementing social distancing protocols or virtually.

    Accessibility accommodations will continue to be provided through the Saints Success Center including, but not limited to, the following:
        Accommodated testing services
        Note-taking
        Recording lectures
        Electronic textbooks
        Text/speech software
        Assisted technologies
        Vocational rehabilitation services
        Tutoring is available in-person or virtually and can be scheduled online.

Corette Library and Simperman Learning Commons

The Library and Learning Commons will continue to offer services to Carroll students, faculty and staff. To ensure the safety of all, the following guidelines will be followed:

    Library interior doors schedule is as follows:
    Unlocked (for campus use only):
    - M-TH: 7:45 am to 6:00 pm
    - F: 7:45 am - 4:30 pm
    Key Card Accessibility for students and employees:
    - M-TH: 6:00 pm - 10:00 pm
    - Sat: 12:00 - 4:00 pm
    - Sun: 12:00 - 8:00 pm
    Library interior doors are locked 24/7 and a Carroll College ID card is required to gain entry.  Hours of operation and some services may be modified in order to maintain appropriate health and safety measures for staff and patrons as well as allow for appropriate levels of sanitation and cleaning.
    Public access to the Library has been suspended until further notice. The public will not be allowed to check out materials at this time, nor use the facility. 
    Per College requirements, anyone entering the Library and Learning Commons must wear a face covering at all times through Phase 2.
    Library services will be provided either in-person implementing social distancing protocols or virtually.
    The circulation desk and course reserves cart are self-service with the checkout of materials available by using the Carroll ID number.
    Where possible with availability of the format and budget, we are trying to transition to electronic course reserves.  For physical course reserves, the recommended best practice by the American Library Association is to quarantine lending materials like books. At this time, we are practicing a minimum 3-day quarantine for physical items.
    The librarian information desk has been converted to a drop-in station for students to access live on-line help from a librarian.
    The Library is no longer placing interlibrary loan requests for physical items; however, it is still possible to place interlibrary loans for digital materials.
    Although the majority of the Library’s collection can be accessed electronically, efforts are being made to convert frequently used resources from the existing physical collection into e-books and publications when possible.
    Services from the writing and communication centers will continue to be available through the learning commons with adherence to required health and safety protocols.
