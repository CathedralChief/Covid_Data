Campus-wide guidance applicable to all sectionsSymptoms of COVID-19 and self-monitoringStudent, faculty and staff familiarity with the symptoms of COVID-19 will be key to reducing the risk of the virus spreading this fall. We urge all members of the university to be familiar with the symptoms described by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and to self-monitor on a daily basis. The known symptoms are listed in Appendix G. Students, faculty and staff who have symptoms are to:• Immediately contact their health care provider. In the case of students this will usually be MSU  University Health Partners, located in the Swingle Building on campus.• Students are to stay home from classes. Students are to contact their faculty for accommodations. For more      detail see Academic Affairs.• Faculty and staff are to immediately notify their supervisor and stay home from work. For more details, see       Human Resources.In addition, MSU strongly encourages every member of our campus community to assess themselves for symptoms and to personally check their temperature every day before coming to campus. Individuals should not come to work and should contact their health care provider if they have a fever or elevated temperature of 100.4 degrees or higher.Cloth face masks and face coveringsCloth face masks are one of the tools the campus community can use to help slow the spread of the virus. Since people can carry and spread the virus without having symptoms, or with very mild symptoms, wearing a cloth face mask helps protect those around you, and the community at large, by reducing the risk of virus spread. While a cloth face mask may not protect the wearer, it may keep the wearing from spreading the virus to others, according to the CDC, as droplets from sneezes, coughs and even talking can spread the virus as much as 6 feet.  In general, cloth face masks and face coverings will be strongly recommended for students, faculty, staff and visitors while on campus, especially in situations where a 6-foot distance between individuals cannot be maintained inside MSU buildings. Students will each be provided one cloth face mask for personal use for fall. Cloth face masks and face coverings will be required in specific areas and circumstances that include, but are not limited to: employees serving food, sick students visiting the student health center, some laboratories where the use of protective face masks was part of protocols before the COVID-19 pandemic, and some clinical settings that are part of a student’s education in a medical field. Faculty and instructors will be provided their preference of face shields or cloth face masks to wear in the classroom. Face shields may be useful for instructional faculty because students can more easily read lips and observe facial expressions. Requests for personal protection equipment should be made by unit or department supervisors to the MSU Office of Safety and Risk Management. Appendix D of this report provides links to the CDC’s guidance on cloth face masks and face coverings, as well as MSU resources for posters on face mask use. Social distancing of 6 feetAll areas of the campus will observe, to the extent practicable, the CDC guidance on maintaining 6 feet of distance between individuals. This is an important tool in reducing the spread of the novel coronavirus. The CDC’s comprehensive guidance on social distancing and its benefits in reducing the spread of the virus can be found in Appendix F of this report where readers can also find a link to MSU’s extensive library of social distancing posters available for download and social media materials for use.   10
Hand washingAnother critical tool in reducing the spread of the virus is frequent handwashing. Students, faculty and staff are strongly encouraged to wash their hands and use hand sanitizer extensively. The federal guidance on hand washing can be found in Appendix E of this document.   MSU Clean ‘Cat Kit: personal sanitization for all students, faculty and staffIn order to assist faculty, students and staff, MSU will implement the Clean ‘Cat Kit for the fall semester 2020. The MSU Clean ‘Cat Kit is a personal sanitization program that empowers the campus community to take personal action to protect themselves. These personal kits will be used by recipients to sanitize areas they use during the day, such as podiums, desks and seats in classrooms, meeting rooms and collaboration spaces. To facilitate access to hand-sanitizer gel and disinfectant spray, campus hand-sanitizer refill stations will be deployed throughout campus. This approach provides constant access to cleaning materials for those on campus daily and reduces queuing, crowding and touch-transmissions issues. Each MSU faculty, student and staff will receive a MSU Clean ‘Cat Kit upon their arrival for the fall semester. We anticipate the kit will include: • 1 reusable disinfectant spritz bottle, prefilled and labeled with use instructions.• 3 microfiber cloths to use with disinfectant on surfaces throughout the day. • 1 reusable gel hand sanitizer bottle, prefilled. • Personal care and community safety information. • Carrying bag. • One cloth face mask.Testing and contact tracing The university will work to support the monitoring, testing and tracing efforts, as well as quarantine and isolation protocols advised by the Centers for Disease Control, the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services, and the Gallatin City-County Health Department. Testing Due to the number of tests available, current national and regional guidance does not call for, or provide, testing for everyone with symptoms.  As the number of available test kits and processing capacity expand, this guidance could be modified. Additionally, there are ongoing local and state efforts to expand testing as fall 2020 approaches. At this time, coordination for testing must occur through a health care provider, local urgent care facilities, or Bozeman Health. Some important resources include:• University Health Partners: Students will be able to access testing through MSU University Health                Partners, located in the Swingle Building on campus.• Bozeman Health COVID-19 Hotline:  The Bozeman Health COVID-19 Hotline can be reached at 406-     414-2619. Hotline hours are weekdays from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. and weekends from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.• Drive-Up COVID-19 Test Sites: Drive-up test sites are available for patients with an order from a provider.     For drive-up testing, patients remain in the vehicles for a nasal swab that will be used to test for COVID-19.    There are currently two drive-up test sites in Bozeman:• Bozeman Health Deaconess Hospital (Lot G): Hours are Monday – Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.• Bozeman Health Belgrade Clinic + UrgentCare: Hours are Monday – Friday 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. and  Saturday 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. • Urgent Care:b2 Urgent Care on Main Street and Bozeman Health Belgrade Clinic Urgent Care are both   open and able to care for assessing COVID-19 symptoms and other health concerns.11
Contact tracing The CDC provides guidance for COVID-19 contact tracing. Those guidelines are intended to provide state and local health departments flexibility to respond rapidly to changing local circumstances. Key concepts from the CDC that are being implemented and/or considered by university, local and state health officials include:• Trace and monitor contacts of infected people. Notify them of their exposure.• Support the quarantine of contacts. Help ensure the safe, sustainable and effective quarantine of contacts to   prevent additional transmission.• Expand staffing resources. Contact tracing require that states, tribes, localities and territories establish large     cadres of contact tracers. • Use digital tools. Adoption and evaluation of digital tools may expand reach and efficacy of contact tracers.Wastewater monitoring In collaboration with the city and county health department, MSU is leveraging faculty research expertise to monitor municipal wastewater for coronavirus levels in our community.  This collaboration between the city, county and MSU will be an important data point in holistic assessments and additional guidance this fall semester. To read more about the MSU wastewater monitoring, visit the following University Communications press release: https://www.montana.edu/news/19958/msu-researchers-show-wastewater-can-help-monitor-manage-coronavirus. The Gallatin City-County Health Department publishes the results of that monitoring at: https://www.healthygallatin.org/coronavirus-covid-19/wastewater-data/. 12

After being allowed entry, student-athletes must perform hand hygiene (Appendix E). They are then allowed use of all open Montana State University athletic facilities for that calendar day. This includes, but is not limited to, the locker rooms, weight room, training room and administrative offices. If an athlete departs and returns to the facility in the same day, they do not need re-screening, provided they can present their wrist band for that day. They will, however, need to sign in each time they enter that day. If a person shows a fever, cough or shortness of breath; is COVID-19-positive; or is awaiting test results, then they will be masked and directed to self-quarantine. The screener will immediately contact a Bozeman Health provider. That person will not be allowed entry. (Note: Individuals with a positive COVID-19 lab test more than 10 days prior and who have been fully recovered from symptomatic COVID-19 for at least 72 hours are allowed entry.) Exit All MSU staff, visitors, and student-athletes will exit through the South Entrance of Brick Breeden Fieldhouse. All student-athletes will sign out each time they leave the building (Appendix C).Face mask or face coveringAll MSU staff and student-athletes are required to bring their own personal cloth face covering or mask when using any MSU athletics facility and to wear the mask or covering at all times while on the premises, unless social distancing is practiced.6If a student-athlete refuses to wear a face covering, they will not be allowed to participate in Athletic Department activities and will be asked to leave the premises.Group games and use of shared objects/ballsThis protocol is made in alignment with the NCAA Sports Science Institute Core Principles of Resocialization of Collegiate Sport as published at the time of this report.• No activities that require direct (e.g., hitting in football) or indirect (e.g., high jump pit, basketball) contact      between athletes are allowed at this time. It is not only difficult to avoid contact, but there is also uncertainty    about shared balls and virus transmission.• MSU Student-athletes can use objects/balls for individual drills but may not participate in group activities  using shared objects/balls at this time. Examples of prohibited activities include, but are not limited     to, passing a ball regardless of sport, pick-up games, shooting drills where someone else collects the ball other    than the individual student-athlete, shared use of shotput/javelin/discus/hammer/baton, etc. • If a ball is being used, make sure only one player is using a specific region of the court and/or basket at a time, and the court in that region needs to be cleaned before another player uses it to prevent indirect transmission    from ball to ground and vice versa. • Athletic equipment must be sanitized after use. For example, after an individual student-athlete finishes a  shooting drill or setting drill, they must sanitize the basketball or volleyball, and the court must be sanitized. Hand hygieneMSU Student-athletes will perform the following hand hygiene7• upon entering the building• before exiting the building• after using the rest room• before eating • after touching another student-athlete or another student-athlete’s immediate environment• after contact with blood, body fluids, or contaminated surfaces. This includes one’s owns body fluids (such as    22
coughing or sneezing into hands)• cough into their elbow rather than handsLaundering and clothing • MSU Student-athletes are required to turn in their used workout clothing to the department’s laundry services for cleaning. • MSU Student-athletes are required to arrive in street clothes and change into workout clothing prior to  working out. (If entering the facility for non-physical activity, such as a meeting or medical provider visit,  student-athletes do not need to change.)• After working out, MSU student-athletes are required to proceed to their locker room, shower, change into      street clothes, and place dirty athletic clothing into laundry.• MSU student-athlete clothing will be laundered as per usual protocol by MSU athletics staff.Locker room use Locker room use will be limited to changing clothes, bathing or showering, and rest room use. The maximum number of occupants at one time will be limited to 10 or 50, as directed by local authorities, as social distancing cannot be guaranteed in a locker room.Other rules:• Locker room use will be limited to 10 minutes per group/athlete.• Six feet of distance will be encouraged in the showers if there are no dividers/curtains.• Athletes will use either wall mounted soap/shampoo or their own individual soap/shampoo. (Sharing of  personal hygiene products is not allowed.)• All lounge furniture will be removed to reduce socializing.• All food and drink will be removed.Self-monitoring, entrance screening and exit protocol of student-athletes• Self-monitoring and entrance screening are important aspects of early identification of COVID-19 infection    and serve to minimize exposure to others. All student-athletes are advised to self-monitor daily. This includes    taking one’s temperature, if the student-athlete has access to a thermometer at their residence.  This can be documented on the Self-Monitoring Sheet (Appendix B).• If self-monitoring shows a fever (100.4 F or above), or any COVID-19 symptom, then the individual is to  stay home and seek medical advice prior to coming onto campus.Training room protocol• Student-athletes will be scheduled by athletic training, physical therapy and medical staff to minimize the  number of individuals using the training room at a given time.• Utilization of athletic training and physical therapy services will be delivered as deemed appropriate by an  athletic trainer, physical therapist or medical provider, on a case by case basis.• Hot and cold-water baths are prohibited unless directed by the head team physician.• Hot packs may be used, but the cloth sleeve must be laundered after each use.• Surfaces and objects will be cleaned at least once daily and after each use according to the disinfection               protocol.• Athletic department staff and medical providers evaluating and treating student-athletes should wear a face       mask at all times while in the training room/weight room.23
Travel-related quarantine and essential/urgent medical careThe MSU Athletics Department will use, and augment, the State of Montana’s phased reconstitution plan (Appendix H) with regard to quarantine requirements. Traveling within the U.S.As of June 1, 2020, the MSU Athletics Department will adopt a mandatory 10-day quarantine period for those coming from outside of Montana but inside the United States.Roommates/housemates of those required to quarantine will also be required to quarantine for 10 days, unless alternative housing can be arranged for the student-athlete requiring quarantine, prior to their arrival.Traveling from outside the U.S.On and after June 1, 2020, student-athletes coming from international locations will quarantine for 14 days, per Centers of Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.Exceptions can be made to this policy for essential or urgent medical care. Examples of essential medical care include urgent medical visits that cannot be performed via telehealth or otherwise as deemed necessary for a medical provider.Pre-participation exams for incoming student-athletes are not essential medical care. If a MSU student-athlete who needs a pre-participation exam requires quarantine, the majority of the visit can be completed by telehealth while the student-athlete is in quarantine. After quarantine, the student-athlete will be seen in person for physical exam, EKG, and sickle cell testing. Vulnerable student-athletesVulnerable individuals are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality if they contract COVID-19.During Phases 1 and 2 of the State of Montana’s reopening plan8, it is recommended that all vulnerable individuals shelter in place. During Phase 3, vulnerable individuals can resume public interactions but should practice social distancing, minimizing exposure to social settings where distancing may not be practical, unless precautionary measures are observed.Vulnerable individuals include those with serious underlying health conditions including: • Moderate to severe asthma requiring daily controller medication. Mild or exercise induced asthma are not               included.• Heart disease including high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, heart failure, cardiomyopathies, and  pulmonary hypertension• Chronic lung disease (such as COPD)• Diabetes• Those whose immune systems are compromised, such as by chemotherapy for cancer and other conditions  requiring such therapy.• Chronic liver disease• Severe obesity (BMI over 40)9Vulnerable student-athletes may be identified at any time as clinically indicated by a provider.Weight room/exercise protocolThis protocol uses recommendations from the NCAA COVID-19 advisory panel exercise recommendations.• MSU Student-athletes may use the weight room and exercise in or on MSU athletic facilities and fields only     under direct supervision by strength training or athletic training staff.• Each work-out group will be overseen by an appropriate AED/CPR trained member of the MSU athletics  24
staff as dictated by NCAA policy.• Only MSU student-athletes are allowed to use weight room facilities at this time.• If social distancing cannot be maintained, group size is limited according to below, as directed by local               authorities.• Phase 1: Per State of Montana, groups of 10 maximum • Phase 2: Per State of Montana, groups of 50 maximum. However, MSU Athletics will have a maximum group size of 20. This is due to the logistics/staffing of screening and monitoring large groups and to decrease the potential exposure of an athlete who has the COVID-19 virus. This group size may enlarge       over time as deemed safe and appropriate by medical and administrative staff. • MSU student-athletes will be divided into workout groups. Once the groups are established, student-athletes must remain in their groups while working out, both that day and for the future, until otherwise directed.  This will help minimize exposure if there is a sick student-athlete in a group.• MSU Athletics department staff will create exercise protocols that can maintain social distancing.• This may require staggering used and unused equipment.• Activities that require spotting should be designed to minimize the number of spotters required (e.g., low weight, high repetition).• MSU Student-athletes and MSU Athletics Department staff will use a cloth face covering within the weight     room or while participating in/overseeing MSU-university-sanctioned athletic activities per the Athletics face    covering protocol above. Face coverings are not needed during activities that are compliant with social               distancing.             • If an MSU student-athlete refuses to wear a face covering, they will not be allowed to participate in MSU  Athletics Department activities and will be asked to leave the premises.• All individuals are strongly encouraged to minimize physical contact. However, physical contact may occur,      such as in spotting to prevent injury. If physical contact occurs hand hygiene must be performed. • Social distancing is encouraged during aerobic exercise (running, sprinting, etc.).  MSU student-athletes should consider arranging themselves side by side rather than front to back at a distance of at least 5 yards.• Shared equipment should be sanitized with a disinfectant after each use by the user. This includes free weights, mats, kettlebells, medicine balls, stability balls, bars, etc. If shared equipment cannot be sanitized between use,  it should not be used. 25
Dining halls Contact: Thomas Stump, Associate Vice President for Auxiliary Services, stump@montana.eduMitigating the risk of infection of our students, faculty and staff is of paramount importance. During the 2020 fall semester, Miller Dining Commons and Rendezvous Dining Pavilion will be open and will remain focused on providing a healthy and clean environment. Dining facilities accommodations will include moves to “grab-and-go” formats, enhanced custodial services, scheduled deep cleans, points of control to monitor and enforce social distancing, appropriate seating configurations and directional signage. Consistent communication of adaptations and protocols will be provided through supporting marketing documents, including appropriate signage strategically placed throughout the dining venues. Sanitization AdjustmentsThe normal sanitization program will be enhanced, and site-specific adjustments will be made to minimize the risk to our guests:• Self-service areas (salad bars, breakfast nooks, hot service lines) will be evaluated to determine how best to  serve our guests.• Beverage areas (soda fountains, coffee stations, milk dispensers) will be reviewed and specific programming  will be put in place.• Dispensing areas (condiments, silverware, napkins) will be assessed and alternative solutions will be developed.• Cashier, service and seating areas will be evaluated and adjusted accordingly to support social distancing               guidelines.• Catering Services’ operations will be evaluated to adhere to social distancing guidelines.• Guest-facing technology alternatives will be developed to meet the changing needs of our guests. • Custodial services will be provided with appropriate personal protective equipment for cleaning and  disinfecting common, non-clinical spaces in general accordance with CDC guidelines.Considerations for MSU Culinary Services customers and dinersAll customers/diners will be strongly encouraged to wear protective face masks or coverings while walking around the dining hall. These may be removed when sitting and dining.The number of diners in a single facility will be limited to achieve appropriate social distancing. Approaches to regulate the number of diners will include controlled entry and limiting mealtime length. After the facility’s capacity is reached, incoming diners will only be allowed entry after another leaves, and mealtimes of 30 minutes or less inside the dining halls will be encouraged.Steps taken to maintain appropriate social distancing may also include:• Specifying entry and exit points and providing signs to direct foot traffic.• Socially spaced floor markers in queuing locations, such as outside the facility.• Adjusted spacing between tables and a limited number of chairs per table.• Eliminating buffet-style, self-serve food and beverage stations, replacing them with staff-served stations.• Providing optional grab-and-go offerings.• Arranging food delivery to students in isolation or quarantine.Considerations for MSU Culinary Services staffA COVID-19 Health Awareness Plan will be in place and followed by all staff members. Each site will be provided with a daily health screening questionnaire and checklist to ensure the health of the staff. All dining facility staff will be 26
required to wear protective face masks and gloves at all times while working and interacting with the public. Employees will be required to follow infection prevention guidelines including:• Staying home when ill.• Practicing social distancing whenever possible at work.• Maintain good hygiene consistent with CDC guidelines.• Avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.• Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces throughout the workday.• Self-checking temperatures prior to leaving home for work

HousingContact: Thomas Stump, Associate Vice President for Auxiliary Services, stump@montana.eduMSU’s housing mission, under Auxiliary Services, is to parallel the goals of the university by providing a safe learning environment and a comprehensive community experience to maximize the success of our students. MSU Housing and Residence LifeStudent residents arriving to campus are required to take necessary steps as determined by MSU, in consultation with state and local government and health officials, to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This guidance will be provided to students and families prior to their arrival on campus. Fall capacityLiving options within MSU’s 13 undergraduate residence halls for the fall 2020 semester will not be limited to single-occupancy configurations. In the vast majority of configurations, residence hall rooms will be limited to a maximum of two occupants. Campus residence hall capacity will be managed to reserve separate locations for quarantine and isolation housing as needed for residence life occupants. The university has no facilities to quarantine or isolate students who live off campus.  Given the self-contained physical structure of units at Family/Graduate Housing, occupancy is expected to be at normal levels.Guidance for resident studentsFor the fall semester of 2020, additional requirements will be placed on residents. These include a Housing Contract Addendum that details how residents’ personal belongings will be handled should they be asked to vacate with little notice due to local health conditions, as well as requirements specified in Student Safety Plans, Public Health Guidelines, and Processes for Move-In and Move-Out that will be implemented. MSU Student Safety PlansAll students living on campus will be encouraged to create a Student Safety Plan to be activated in the event of an emergency. For each student resident, elements of a safety plan will include answers to the following questions:• Where will the student individual shelter in the unlikely event that on-campus housing needs to close for  health and safety reasons?• What transportation options exist for the student? • Does the student have access to a vehicle?• Does the student have a registered vehicle on campus? • Is the student dependent on public transportation?• How quickly can the student get to the designated location given the transportation options?• What is the student’s detailed emergency contact information?Public health guidelines The following sanitization, hygiene and social distancing requirements will be implemented in residence halls:• MSU strongly encourages that face masks or face coverings be worn in common areas where social distancing   is difficult to achieve, such as restrooms, laundry rooms and hallways.• Hand sanitizing stations will be available at designated building entrances.• Dedicated entrances and exits with foot traffic guides will be identified and marked to provide a single point     of entry.30
• Occupancy for dorm rooms will, in the vast majority of configurations, be limited to a maximum of two  students per room.• Approved configurations for double occupancy room will maximize social distancing. No bunking of beds will be permitted.• Reduced capacity will be implemented in elevators with social distancing floor indicators and, where feasible,    one elevator car designed for going up and another for going down. • Restricted use of building lounges, common areas and kitchens will be enforced.• Residence Life staff members will increase hall monitoring to promote social distancing expectations.• Enhanced awareness and programming will promote social, mental and academic well-being, as well as  promotion of available services from the Division of Student Success, such as counseling and tutoring. • Directional indicators and appropriate signage will be installed in lounge rooms, restrooms and laundry rooms indicating occupancy limits and foot traffic patterns.• A Restricted Guest Policy will be in place and enforced for the duration of the fall semester.• Cleaning and disinfecting schedules will be expanded into the evening hours. This is in addition to enhanced    cleaning of shared areas and bathroom spaces during the day and on the weekends.Guidelines for move-in/move-outNew guidelines will be established for welcoming MSU student residents to campus for the fall 2020 semester:• Move-in and -out days and times will be expanded to allow social distancing.• Cleaning of residence hall common spaces will be enhanced during move-in and move-out.• The number of support staff allowed in the residence hall will be limited.• Residence Life staff will wear cloth face masks.• Incoming residence students will select and honor a specific time slot for move-in. • Residence hall elevators will be designated for single-family use, per trip. • Directional traffic patterns will be designated and marked in stairwells and hallways.  • Communication templates and forms will be distributed outlining plans and resources, in case a sudden move out is required. COVID-19 quarantine and isolation housing MSU will identify facilities for the temporary housing and care of MSU students living in the residence halls who cannot travel back home or to an off-site respite location but must be quarantined or isolated. This includes spaces for quarantining MSU residence hall students who may have been exposed and may be infected with COVID-19 but are asymptomatic, as well as for isolating MSU residence hall students who are symptomatic, awaiting medical test results, or with probable or confirmed infection of COVID-19. MSU’s COVID-19 response plan includes processes to identify residence hall residents who appear to have symptoms (such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath) and provide them with isolation housing until they can get a test confirmation. This is an important and effective strategy to mitigate further spread of the

new programming that meets social distancing and group size guidelines.• The Office of Student Engagement (OSE) will host virtual events, social media engagement opportunities and asynchronous activities. The office will work on new ways for students to have social interaction and build communities. The office will support student organizations to redesign their traditional in-person  tudent events. MSU University Health PartnersContact: James Mitchell, Senior Director, jimm@montana.eduFollowing an integrated, collaborative model, MSU University Health Partners UHP) unites the components of the health and well-being for MSU students including prevention, health promotion, public health, medical services, dental services, and counseling and psychological services.Medical ServicesOperations• Require all MSU student patients to call ahead to schedule an appointment before coming to the UHP  Medical Services for nursing or provider visits.• Screen all student patients and staff for respiratory symptoms and check temperature upon entering the clinic.• Update screening forms to include chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, loss of ability to smell or taste, and any other COVID-19 symptoms.• Develop processes to facilitate that student patients complete and submit forms (health history,  immunizations, consents, etc.) in the patient portal or utilize a UHP template.• Continue to utilize telemedicine visits and provide students with options for telemedicine or telephone  consultations when appropriate. In particular, students with conditions placing them at higher risk for  complications from COVID-19 should be encouraged to seek care via telemedicine.• Develop an online process for patient check-in.• Develop protocols for managing student patients with acute respiratory symptoms that include masking the patient, quickly rooming the patient, limiting and tracking the number of staff who enter the room,  limiting the movement of the patient throughout the UHP Medical Services, and cleaning of spaces where the  patient was present.• Avoid use of nebulizers and peak flow measurements which can generate additional aerosols. • Require all patients to wear face masks (or cloth face coverings if adequate face masks are not available).• Prohibit visitors, children or accompanying guests who are not receiving care or services from entering the               facility.• Continue to transport student patients requiring a higher level of care to Bozeman Health Deaconess               Hospital.• Develop a communications plan outlining key messages such as how to access care and schedule appointments and which visits should be in person versus virtual. • Use a variety of platforms in communicating these messages, including websites, social media and signage. Involve as many campus entities as possible.Dental ServicesUHP Dental Services will follow relevant UHP Medical Services guidance, as well as guidance from the American Dental Association for safe operation of dental practices during the COVID-19 pandemic.43
Counseling and Psychological ServicesMental health impactAll MSU students are affected by the pandemic and will experience a range of impacts on their mental health. Measures intended to limit the spread of the coronavirus have also led to experiences of anxiety, fear, grief and uncertainty. These emotional reactions are normal responses to an unexpected and scary situation. The effects of social distancing, loneliness, isolation, economic losses and grief will continue to take their toll on all of us. For those with previous histories of trauma or mental disorders, the pandemic could exacerbate symptoms or contribute to a new episode of a mental health disorder that had been stable. CPS remains committed to supporting the MSU community and will continue to provide counseling, outreach and consultation services to students, faculty and staff. Although the number of case and loss of life has been less in Montana compared to other parts of the country and world, many students have been impacted by grief and loss. They are working to continue their education while cut off from their usual support systems, which may typically be an important part of the grieving process. Some students may be feeling unsafe as they fear or experience discrimination and/or bias incidents related to the pandemic. Many students are dealing with significant financial stressors, food insecurity, lack of housing and other economic stressors. Each of these may contribute to the need for more professional mental health support.Clinical services transitioned to tele-mental health CPS has moved all clinical services to tele-mental health. Students who contact CPS are connected with a counselor via telephone. During that appointment, the counselor conducts a brief assessment to ensure the student is appropriate for the tele-mental health modality and helps them get established for ongoing tele-mental health appointments with a CPS counselor. These sessions take place over a videoconferencing platform. Students complete necessary forms online in advance of the appointment through a secure web component. State laws and regulations governing the practice of counseling, as well as licensure requirements that differ across all 50 states, create challenges to provide these services to students who are currently out of state. CPS has sought legal counsel on how to navigate this obstacle and a has developed a strategy to track each state’s laws and ensure counselors are practicing within the bounds of that state. Students residing outside of Montana are informed of this obstacle with their first contact at CPS, and depending on the student’s location, treatment options are discussed. CPS staff members work with the student to identify referral options within their current state of residence if state law does not allow for cross-state practice. Students are provided online resources, including access to the self-help app for MSU students as well as crisis resources.While tele-mental health is an important option and has certainly helped many students during this time, it is also less than ideal for many. Students may struggle to have a stable internet connection, lack a private space in which they can share the most intimate and private details of their lives, or be in an unsafe environment. These challenges, and others, are important considerations as CPS considers future services and the role of telemental health as a service option. CPS will continue to prioritize tele-mental health options for students seeking mental health services. Two senior staff clinicians will be on-site each day throughout the summer to respond to any walk-in or urgent situations. However, in those instances, the staff person will conduct a brief in-person assessment and consider scheduling the follow-up as a tele-mental health appointment. Crisis procedures have been considered and determined in collaboration with University Police as well as community partners. Limiting number of people in CPSThe CPS space in the Swingle Health Center building has been operating above capacity for years. To address social distancing requirements, staff will stagger their schedule with only two senior staff members present each day through the summer. Students will be asked to call prior to entering CPS so staff can ensure there is space. Waiting room seating has been reduced to allow for social distancing. CPS offices do not allow for social distancing, and not all the offices are well-ventilated. If a student must be seen in person, staff have identified one office that is large enough to accommodate an in-person visit. 44
As staff members return to campus, they will provide tele-mental health appointments from their campus offices, but many will telework from home to limit the numbers of people in Swingle. The CPS satellite offices at Culbertson Hall are larger and allow for social distancing. Students who can access services there and who are unable to engage in tele-mental health may work with a counselor in one of the Culbertson offices. Meetings will be held via videoconferencing. Protocol for in-person visitsMSU Students and staff will be discouraged from entering CPS if they exhibit any symptoms identified by the CDC. Hand hygiene will be encouraged with the addition of hand sanitizing stations throughout CPS. Masks or face coverings will be strongly encouraged for both students and staff in any common areas. Counseling often involves raised voices, crying and approximately one hour in an enclosed space, which increases the risk for transmitting the virus. To protect both students and staff, in-person visits will be discouraged unless there are no alternatives. Sanitization operations and the frequency of surface cleanings will increase and include wiping of common area surfaces throughout the day, discontinuing client use of iPads to complete forms and increased custodial services. Legal/ethical considerationsMSU Staff will continue to monitor state laws and options for practicing across state lines. If a MSU staff member or client is diagnosed with COVID-19, CPS will amend its informed consent document and outline procedures for contact tracing, prior to the resumption of in-person services. MSU Legal Counsel will review the amended informed consent prior to implementation. All clients will be required to complete this informed consent prior to the onset of any in-person services. MSU Students receiving tele-mental health will be asked to sign a specific tele-mental health informed consent, which identifies their emergency contact and when the counselor would break confidentiality to contact that person. Clients will confirm their physical location at the start of each tele-mental health appointment.Group therapy and outreachGroup therapy and outreach will continue virtually. Specific connection spaces have been developed for students who are parents, American Indian students, graduate students and graduating seniors.Outreach services will continue virtually with live programs as well as recorded videos that can be used in classes, with student groups, or on social media. Office of Health AdvancementThe role of health advancement in a healthy campus is multilayered and founded in a prevention framework. Assessment, environmental change strategies, social marketing, social norming, peer education training and health education programs are just a few components. Health advancement also houses alcohol and other drug (AOD) services including the collegiate recovery community, interpersonal violence (IPV) prevention, sexual health and STI resources, wellness coaching and nutrition and travel health services and the Bounty of the Bridgers Food Pantry. General program deliveryDue to restrictions placed on in-person events based on local and state public health conditions and requirements, health advancement will develop a range of delivery methods. Many health education programs and trainings are easily transferable to a virtual environment; however, for some programs, there is no replacement for in-person, hands-on interaction. Placing content online could allow capacity for more frequent but smaller peer trainings or programs that are not conducive to the virtual setting. Health advancement offerings carry various levels of risk based on the size, physical proximity of participants, nature of the activity and vulnerability of the population. OHA will consult with campus or public health partners to develop a 45
risk assessment and plan for various types of activities. In general: • Programs will be limited to 10 attendees.  • Each program will begin with a brief instructional session reviewing hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette,  symptoms of COVID-19 and staying home when sick. • Program attendees should continue appropriate social distancing and use face coverings during these onsite                    programs.             • Health Advancement will work to educate students, faculty and staff on the importance of self-care and self-monitoring at the beginning of each day, encouraging all to stay home if there is any question of exposure   or illness.Bounty of the Bridgers Bounty of the Bridgers food pantry will continue to follow the same protocol as the Gallatin Valley Food Bank. Individual appointments will be made to obtain resources with minimal personal contact. Food handling will be kept to a minimum and following proper food safety protocol. Monetary donations instead of food donations will be encouraged for those wishing to support the pantry.  Crash PadThe Crash Pad housing for students in crisis has been reduced to maintain distancing efforts. Each available room will accommodate an individual student. Each case will be evaluated by the program manager for Crash Pad as well as the Dean of Students Office and housing personnel.Other programsIndividual visits for nutrition evaluations and counseling, AOD consultations, wellness coaching and travel health sessions, along with sexual health education will be performed via telehealth until social distancing restrictions are relaxed for the campus and local community. Case-by-case decisions on in-person interactions with students requesting interpersonal violence assistance or other sensitive discussions must weigh the needs of the student against the potential health impact on the staff. Any staff member with direct student encounters will be provided appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and practice social distancing. Physical space will be disinfected with the necessary cleaning solutions provided through Facilities Services on campus. Additionally, all staff will wear PPE while in common areas of the office. Departmental meetings will be held remotely through WebEx as needed unless social distancing measures can be observed. Collaboration on communicationsHealth Advancement will collaborate with Medical Services and Counseling and Psychological Services, as well as the broader campus leadership and specialists, including University Communications, to plan and implement communications and marketing effort
