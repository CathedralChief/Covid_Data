At the University of Miami, we are fortunate to have a world-class health system in UHealth and the very best minds in public health guiding our plan for the Fall 2020 semester. Based on guidance from public health and government agencies, seven multi-disciplinary committees have been developing our plan, which is rooted in the following four pillars.

Testing, tracing, tele-vigilance, tracking, and teamwork
It is important that all faculty, staff, and students, as well as vendors and campus guests, share the same values and behaviors in protecting the health of the University community. All faculty, staff, and students will be required to complete a new community module, which will introduce these shared behaviors and values, as well as an online COVID-19 screening tool, prior to returning to campus. Once on campus, any member of the University community who experiences COVID-19 or influenza-like symptoms will be required to undergo a COVID-19 test. The University will conduct contact tracing for any confirmed cases, and COVID-19-positive individuals will be required to self-isolate. Spaces are being designated on campus for self-isolation of students who live in on-campus housing, and systems to track disease prevalence and evolution are being developed.

Cleaning and disinfecting
The University will conduct deep cleaning of all campus spaces regularly and with enhanced protocols and increased frequency, and is increasing the number of hand-sanitizer and disinfecting-wipe stations located throughout campuses. Signage also is being installed to remind individuals to wash their hands frequently and clean personal items, such as keyboards, desks, and phones, before and after each use.

Protecting personal space
The University is reengineering spaces to allow for and promote physical distancing, adding signage to help individuals practice it, and installing wellness shields at reception and point-of-sale locations. Masks or face coverings will be required in public areas or when six feet of separation between individuals cannot be guaranteed. Telecommuting will continue to be a primary arrangement for many staff to minimize the number of individuals working in areas simultaneously.

Vaccinating
Collectively, we have a shared responsibility to safeguard the health of all members of our community. Students, faculty, and staff on all campuses will be required to receive the seasonal flu vaccine, as is already the case on the medical campus. The University will grant exemptions for legitimate health and religious reasons.

Symptoms or exposure
Employees: University employees who are experiencing possible symptoms consistent with, or who have been potentially exposed to, COVID-19 should contact the University’s COVID-19 hotline at 305-243-ONE-U. The hotline is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Hotline staff can assess the specific circumstances related to your condition, offer guidance and access to testing, and provide directions on isolation and quarantine.

Students: Students who are experiencing possible symptoms consistent with, or who have been potentially exposed to, COVID-19 should contact the University’s COVID-19 hotline at 305-243-ONE-U and should follow the guidance on the Student Health Service website at miami.edu/shs-covid.

Personalized medicine program
The University has developed a personalized medicine program specifically for faculty, on-campus staff, and students to promote the importance of good health and provide guidance and care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Should you need care or support, there are many options available to you through UHealth and Student Health Service. To reach a provider 24 hours a day, seven days a week, please call the COVID-19 hotline at 305-243-ONE-U.

Roy E. Weiss, M.D., Ph.D., has been appointed University of Miami Chief Medical Officer for COVID-19, and can be reached directly at covidcmo@miami.edu.

Additional information for students is available here.

Shared behaviors
Face coverings are mandatory at all times while in public spaces on our campuses, whether indoors or outdoors. Failure to follow this requirement will result in disciplinary action for students, faculty, and staff. This is a matter of public health in which the entire community must act in concert to help one another. The CDC does not recommend use of face shields for normal, everyday activities or as a substitute for cloth face coverings.
Students, faculty, and staff on all campuses will be required to receive the seasonal flu vaccine, as already required for clinical employees on our Medical Campus. We will grant exemptions for legitimate health and religious reasons. Additional information will be shared in September.
All students, faculty, and staff planning to be present on any University of Miami campus or access any of its facilities must complete a daily symptom checker and abide by the instructions provided. It takes no more than two minutes and provides an easy way to keep the U healthy. The symptom checker can be found at it.miami.edu/daily-symptom-checker or via the UMiami mobile app.
Before returning to campus
All students should limit their activities and self-quarantine prior to their arrival to campus.
Faculty and staff will need to complete the online attestation (health screening) form. If you are identified by your manager to return to campus, you will receive the attestation form link via email, which will need to be completed prior to returning to campus for the first time, as well as after any leave of absence or extended absence from campus. Once cleared by the employee health office and your supervisor, return to work.
Staff at UHealth and the Miller School of Medicine should continue to follow guidance shared by Medical Campus leadership and review the latest Medical Campus advisories and information here.
Students, faculty, and staff who are on campus are required to use a daily symptom checker and respond appropriately to the guidance it provides. (Note: Students are required to test negative for COVID-19 before returning to campus and before accessing the daily symptom checker.) The symptom checker can be found at it.miami.edu/daily-symptom-checker or via the UMiami mobile app.
All students will be required to submit a negative COVID-19 test before returning to campus. Information regarding testing requirements and instructions has been sent directly to students. For resident students, answers to frequently asked questions can be found at miami.edu/housing.
Students who test negative will be cleared to return to campus, and will also be expected to continue to follow CDC guidelines for physical distancing, use of face coverings, hand washing, and limiting contact with others.
Students who test positive will be asked to self-isolate at home in accordance with CDC guidelines and will need to contact Student Health Service to obtain clearance prior to returning to campus. Students with a positive test result should also complete the Student Health Service COVID-19 self-report form.
All students, faculty, and staff will receive a safe return kit when they return to campus. The kit includes a face covering, hand sanitizer, gloves, and other essential items; these items will be the responsibility of faculty, staff, and students thereafter. Employees should coordinate with their managers to obtain a safe return kit prior to their return on campus.  The University will maintain an appropriate inventory of all items should they be required.
A new team of Public Health Ambassadors is forming to support the University’s COVID-19 reopening and operating plan. The student team will be positioned around campus to educate members of the University community on healthy behaviors including physical distancing, wearing face coverings, and encouraging hand washing and using hand sanitizer.
Asymptomatic testing
Students who will be on the Coral Gables or Marine campuses at any point during the fall semester will be required to take a COVID-19 test every two weeks through the UScreen Testing Initiative. This new, mandatory testing requirement applies to any student who comes to campus for any reason, including undergraduate, graduate, and law students, as well as employees enrolled in in-person classes. Additional information about the mandatory testing initiative is available at https://messages.miami.edu/messages/2020/09/09-10-20-mandatory-covid-testing.html.
We will initiate voluntary testing of randomly selected University faculty and staff to monitor the prevalence of infection. This will help us to identify and respond quickly and decisively to any observed uptick in disease in certain areas of campus or groups. If you are selected for testing, as a public health matter, you are strongly encouraged to participate.
Symptomatic testing
Faculty and staff who are experiencing COVID-19-related symptoms or believe they have been exposed to the virus, are not to come to campus, and should call the University's COVID-19 hotline at 305-243-8378. The employee’s exposure risk will be evaluated, and a test will be scheduled if indicated (based on CDC guidelines). If an employee is directed to a campus location to receive the COVID-19 test, they are to remain quarantined until the results of the test are known. They are not to return to work until informed to do so by the employee health office and their manager.
Any students with symptoms of COVID-19, or those who are a close contact to a known positive person, will have access to timely testing at an on-campus testing facility by calling the University's COVID-19 hotline at 305-243-8378 and selecting option #3. For more information, please visit the Student Health Service website.
Positive tests and isolation
Any faculty, staff, or student who tests positive will be required to self-isolate for up to 14 days, based on CDC guidelines, and all positive persons will be asked to identify their close contacts, or those individuals with whom they have spent more than 15 minutes of time within less than 6 feet of space in the 48-72 hours prior to the onset of symptoms. We will be providing testing to close contacts as symptoms develop and/or based on personal risk.
Resident students who test positive for COVID-19 will be placed in an isolation room, either on or off campus. Residents will receive support by a home health agency and designated University case manager. The student’s room and surrounding areas will be sanitized.
Students who live off campus and who test positive for COVID-19 will be required to self-isolate at their place of residence before returning to campus.
Important information regarding testing
Your exposure risk will be evaluated, and a test will be scheduled if indicated (based on CDC guidelines).
It is rarely required to have testing done the same day you develop symptoms or have an exposure. In fact, it takes days after exposure for a polymerase chain reaction test—the predominant coronavirus test—to turn positive.
Test results are generally not available immediately. Result times vary depending on the test and testing site, but results are provided as soon as they are available and typically one to two days after testing.
If you need medical care, your primary care physician (for employees) or Student Health Service (for students) should manage your care. The emergency department should only be used if you experience a medical emergency.
Reporting positive tests conducted outside the University of Miami
Faculty, staff, and students who have a COVID-19 test result from an outside testing facility should email the results report to utrace@miami.edu so contact tracing can be conducted.
Facilities
Our facilities and operations teams are working to maintain a healthy environment for our University community. View the latest facilities actions update.
Protocols to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 in the wastewater for all three campuses have been developed and will be implemented shortly. Similar to random testing, this information will help us map and respond to any potential community spread.
Access to common areas on the Coral Gables and Marine campuses will vary depending on the space. Some spaces will be closed, others, if conditions allow, will be rearranged to decrease density on campus.
Cleaning and disinfecting of spaces utilized by a person testing positive
Based on CDC guidance, enhanced cleaning will be conducted for any on-campus space utilized in the last seven days by a person who has tested positive. Faculty or staff supervisors or academic department chairs who are notified of a person testing positive should enter a request for enhanced cleaning via the following form:
Coral Gables and Marine campuses: miami.edu/sro
Medical/UHealth Campus: https://uhealth-isd.webtma.net/fac/request_fac.html
In the request please include a specific list of known spaces utilized by the individual (i.e. offices, labs, break rooms). Please do not include specific information identifying the individual.
Enhanced cleaning of common touchpoints at building entrances (i.e. front door, back door, main office area entry door) and exits are performed as part of regular cleaning protocols and do not need to be included.
