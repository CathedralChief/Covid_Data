UF Reopening Plan
Pursuant to the Board of Governor’s Blueprint for Opening the State University System
for Fall Semester 2020, the following summary lays out the University of Florida’s plans
for reopening its campus, broadly speaking, as of June 12, 2020.
Our efforts to reopen campus to all employees started in earnest on May 6, 2020. This
was when we committed to screening all employees and offer COVID-19 testing, enabling
them to return to their normal work assignments on campus by June 30. We are also
using the summer months to restore UF’s research enterprise to its full potential. All
these actions are being taken with an eye toward being open and embracing our
students’ return to Gainesville and UF.
UF’s reopening plan has been guided by the medical and public health professionals of UF
Health and has received input from numerous stakeholders, including 11 issue-oriented
task forces, the deans of all 16 colleges and the Emergency Operations Team (Appendix
A). We expect that UF’s plan and implementation will continue to evolve based on the
latest medical and public health developments, as well as guidance from federal, state,
and local officials. We expect that recommendations and mandates from the CDC, the
Florida Department of Health, UF Health, and other experts, will be updated from time to
time before UF’s fall semester begins August 31.
Also, behavioral norms and the ability to enforce expectations on campus will almost
certainly be heavily influenced by what is happening in the rest of society. The more
successful that leaders are in reinforcing a climate of shared responsibility, the more
receptive the campus community is likely to be, although we intend to call on the Gator
Nation to do more and expect more of each other.
Perhaps the most critical factor in the success of UF’s fall semester will be the students
who will arrive on campus from virtually every county in the state, every state in the
nation, and countries on almost every continent. We welcome their return. The university
and community can create an environment that enables the right behaviors and reduces
the spread of COVID-19, but a dynamic campus environment will only be sustained if
everyone—students, faculty, staff, and visitors—takes responsibility for their own health
and safety and the health and safety of those around them.
UF Campus Reopening Plan Fall 2020 9
Finally, the University of Florida has a physical presence in all 67 counties. This document
speaks primarily about UF’s facilities in Alachua County, but analogous, customized
measures should be expected in the sites elsewhere throughout the state, most of which
are part of IFAS or UF Health.
A Healthy Campus Environment
Policies and Procedures
The cornerstone of UF’s reopening plan is the health and welfare of our faculty, staff,
students, patients, vendors and others who come to our campus locations for any reason.
The University of Florida community must work to avoid a COVID-19 flare-up of such
magnitude that it would require the sort of emergency moves that were required during
this spring semester. Thus, our reopening plan has been informed at every turn by the
medical and scientific expertise residing within UF Health and is in accordance with local,
state, and federal guidelines. Health and welfare principles are emphasized in virtually
every communication to the campus community and in UF and UF Health Screen. Test.
Protect. communication materials (Appendix B). In addition, a robust website
(https://coronavirus.ufhealth.org/screen-test-protect) has been created to provide
updated information on the Screen. Test. Protect. program. All individuals who frequent
UF locations will be expected to adhere to the university’s policies, procedures, and
oversight concerning the promotion of a safe and healthy environment. That guidance, as
it relates to faculty and staff is updated regularly and may be found at:
https://hr.ufl.edu/forms-policies/policies-managers/institutional-recovery-and- covid19-return-to-workplace/ Additional student-specific information will be maintained at:
https://sccr.dso.ufl.edu/policies/student-honor-code-student-conduct-code/.
The strategies employed to protect the general population are likely not sufficient for
everyone, especially those at higher risk for developing adverse outcomes associated
with COVID-19. Managers and the university’s Office of ADA Compliance will work with all
individuals—employees, students and visitors—with disabilities or conditions that are at a
high risk of complications from an exposure to the virus SARS-CoV2 or who share a
household with such a person. UF will use an interactive process to provide a conducive
environment for those individuals to engage with our campus resources and
environment. For example, certain employees may request telework as a reasonable 
UF Campus Reopening Plan Fall 2020 10
accommodation to reduce their chances of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of
course, other types of accommodations may be requested and granted depending on
individual circumstances and the roles that they fill.
As discussed later in Academic Program Delivery, UF has taught classes through a variety
of modes in years past and expects to build upon that track record this fall.
Depending on a student’s major course of study, we expect that most undergraduate
students who would prefer to take most or all of their courses remotely would be able to
arrange a schedule to do so. We also expect each college and department to determine
the best mode for delivery for a particular course or section of a course, just as they
always have.
UF plans to offer additional personal protective equipment to faculty and staff who will be
in regular, extended contact with students in enclosed spaces.
Further, we have deployed CDC guidelines, including those concerning physical
distancing (in most cases, a minimum of six feet) and the use of face coverings, across our
enterprise. We have instructed vice presidents, deans, directors, and department heads
to apply physical distancing guidelines within the facilities under their control. Special
attention will be given to constricted areas such as hallways, and lobbies with additional
measures, such as adjusting the path of travel or scheduling of traffic, to minimize close
contact between individuals. University policy will be updated as CDC guidance is
updated, and individuals not complying will be asked to do so or leave the area to help
maintain the safety of our staff, faculty and students.
If an employee does not comply with a directive for wearing an appropriate face covering
in their work location, does not follow physical distancing requirements, or otherwise
does not comply with requirements for working safely, their supervisor will direct the
person to leave the work location immediately, and contact UF Human Resources. The
employee’s behavior may be considered disruptive under University Regulation 1.008
and the employee will be asked to comply or leave the work location. Similarly, students
are subject to UF’s face covering and physical distancing policies. Students failing to
comply with applicable behavioral expectations will be disciplined in accordance with the
student code of conduct.
UF policies apply university-wide and all faculty, staff, students, volunteers, vendors and
visitors to campus are expected to comply with applicable UF policies. As it relates to 
UF Campus Reopening Plan Fall 2020 11
university operations, all contractors, suppliers, vendors and business partners are
required to comply with UF guidelines and polices designed to minimize the spread of
COVID-19, including but not limited to face coverings, physical distancing, hand sanitizing
and cleaning and disinfecting guidelines.
Next, hand sanitizers and sanitizing stations are widely and generously deployed across
campus facilities, and employees and students are instructed in their use through UF’s
robust communications strategy. Employees and students are educated on safe and
healthy practices via a range of information sharing methods, including facility signage,
web sites, emails, training videos, and social media.
In order to foster confidence among our extensive campus community that UF’s facilities
are appropriately maintained for the delivery of teaching, research, and service to the
public, CDC-approved protocols have been established for the cleaning and maintenance
of all UF facilities, including classrooms, offices, housing and dining facilities, research
laboratories and equipment, restrooms, and public spaces (Appendix C). To further
enhance disinfection, common touch points (e.g., doorknobs, phones, keyboards,
elevator buttons, bathroom fixtures, etc.) are receiving special attention with CDCapproved disinfectants.
In terms of athletic activity, the UF Athletic Association has developed, implemented and
will regularly update plans for the return of its employees and student-athletes in
accordance with UF’s policies as well as applicable NCAA and Southeastern Conference
standards. The athletic department’s plans have also been anchored by the expertise of
UF Health and the department has worked closely with campus leadership. All athletic
staff, coaches, and student-athletes will participate in UF Health’s screen-test-protect
program. Decisions about intercollegiate competition will come later and be made in
conjunction with the NCAA and SEC.
Campus Events
Indoor and outdoor events and gatherings at all university-owned, -occupied, or -
controlled lands located within the state of Florida remain suspended through the end of
June 2020, unless an exception is granted by the Vice President of Business Affairs or
designee. The resumption of campus events and gatherings will be gradual and phased
based on local public health conditions, the university’s capacity to execute safety and
security protocols, and after the instructional space needs are defined. The Safe Campus 
UF Campus Reopening Plan Fall 2020 12
Framework Group will be issuing guidelines regarding safe event management. These
guidelines will not address instructional, University Athletic Association, or RecSports
activities. Pre-existing event request/approval processes must be observed for all
campus events and gatherings. The overall goal is ensuring that the maximum allowable
population is welcomed into a maximum number of event spaces while observing
prescribed safety and security protocols of the university and applicable governmental
declarations.
UF will continually assess the current guidance provided by the CDC, the Board of
Governors, and the State of Florida and make adjustments to campus event guidance,
accordingly.
Student Life and Campus Culture
UF’s consideration of the current and projected environment begins with an
acknowledgment that students are returning to Gainesville in large numbers for the fall
semester of 2020.
A critical component of mitigating risk on campus will be the creation of a campus culture
supportive of public health measures to address behaviors necessary for promoting a
safer community. We will need a multifaceted approach to change norms associated with
the use of protective face coverings, increased hygiene, reduction of risky behavior, and
physical distancing.
Our three-pronged approach, grounded in education, opportunities for engagement with
internal and external stakeholders, and enforcement strategies, is rooted in a culture of
care for our community’s health and well-being. This approach to educate, engage and
enforce behavioral expectations on campus applies broadly to students, employees,
volunteers, vendors and guests. Our strategies include:
• Conduct a comprehensive survey of UF students, faculty, and staff to assess
perceptions of behaviors related to COVID-19. This research will likely need to be
updated regularly
• Develop messaging, training, and engagement initiatives that support the predictors
of facial covering usage, hand washing and physical distancing
UF Campus Reopening Plan Fall 2020 13
• Create a shift in campus culture through the application of bystander intervention
skill development, focusing on personal responsibility, involvement, and peer
education
• Disseminate campaign materials that focus on care and civic responsibility, and
• Leverage partnerships with external stakeholders to promote healthy behaviors
All elements of these strategies seek to encourage positive behaviors, whether directed
at student extracurricular activities, Greek organization operations and functions,
student organizations, clubs, intramural sports, or social gatherings. Specific strategies
and places for external marketing and outreach include off- campus gathering places,
bars and restaurants, regional transit system buses, gyms and fitness centers, grocery
stores, and off-campus apartments. We will coordinate with local civic and business
leaders and with nearby Santa Fe College to create an integrated and harmonious
approach that leverages the unique opportunities and contexts that exist throughout the
broader community.
Student groups that wish to reopen in the fall are required to develop and submit a plan
that demonstrates a shared sense of ownership in maintaining a healthy campus and
community.
On-campus Housing
On-campus residential housing is an important component in student success, and we will
continue to honor housing contracts for the fall. The only significant change to normal
occupancy is that the 111 rooms that normally house three students (triples) will house
only two students. UF Housing provides a variety of options for students to consider
when choosing to live on campus and will continue to work with individual students to
address their needs.
A number of other steps have been identified to assist in enhancing students’ health and
safety while living on campus, including: (1) a marketing campaign to encourage healthy
practices and instructions on room cleaning, (2) a modified guest and visitation policy to
limit guests within the residence halls, (3) a continued emphasis on cleaning protocols,
with a focus on high touch surfaces, and (4) the provision of necessary training for staff.
If, in spite of these efforts, a student tests positive for COVID-19, they will be quarantined
to one of several sites identified for purposes of isolating the student for at least 14 days.
During that time, the student will be provided with food, sundries, counseling and other
UF Campus Reopening Plan Fall 2020 14
services as needed. UF has agreements in place with housing and service providers to
ensure that facilities and services are available when needed.
Each sorority or fraternity is required to submit a plan that addresses how the active
chapter, advisors, and relevant housing corporation or similar entity will promote a
healthy environment. That plan must address housing and dining arrangements, cleaning
protocols, and enforcement of relevant public health guidelines. UF Health, the Student
Health Care Center, and the Office of Student Affairs will provide requested information
and suggestions to each sorority and fraternity.
Dining
As it relates to on-campus dining facilities, several steps have been taken in order to
achieve appropriate physical distancing within each dining facility. First, the maximum
occupancy for each facility is pre-determined, with both furniture arrangement and
queuing areas being managed to comply with physical distancing guidelines. Next, selfservice operations are discontinued and service areas where physical distancing is not
possible will remain closed until further notice. Finally, options for outdoor seating and
increased ventilation in dining spaces will be made available, when possible.
Student Health
The mission of the University of Florida Student Health Care Center (SHCC) is to help
every student achieve optimal health in the pursuit of personal and academic success.
The SHCC is an accredited outpatient clinic staffed by licensed, board-certified medical
professionals who provide health and wellness care to UF students. Our medical staff is
comprised of physicians (MDs), physician assistants (PAs), advanced practice registered
nurses (APRNs), registered nurses (RNs), and health support technicians (HSTs). The
resources and capabilities will be augmented by UF Health if needed.
Medical care related to student COVID-19 concerns has been assessed and managed by
SHCC staff since March 2020. SHCC has followed strict procedures aligned with CDC
guidance to both appropriately care for student patients and to promote protection of
the broader community. Students with COVID-19 concerns are managed in a separate
annex of the facility with a dedicated staff assigned to the area operating with personal
protective equipment (PPE). Telehealth visits have also been implemented to conduct
UF Campus Reopening Plan Fall 2020 15
initial assessments and if needed, students come to the SHCC for a drive-by testing
without entering the facility.
Further, the SHCC has worked with the UF Dean of Students in coordinating
comprehensive care for the students’ needs related to a COVID-19 diagnosis including
connecting the student with UF Health medical professionals to be advised on selfquarantine procedures.
A Healthy Community Environment
From the beginning of the pandemic, UF has recognized that the safe and successful
return of employees, students, and visitors to campus will have profound impacts on the
greater Gainesville area. We aspire to be the best partner we can be, remaining mindful
that our relationship with our community is symbiotic—each needing the other to create
a safe environment for employees, students, visitors, volunteers, and surrounding
community members. To bring about this shared responsibility, UF, city, and county
leadership have committed to regular communication and adhering to national and state
guidelines designed to bring about a safe environment (Appendix D).
Every person coming to UF’s campus—whether a faculty member, a staff member,
student, vendor, or visitor—is expected to adhere to the health and safety guidelines
established by the university. The campus community can expect regular communication
concerning the safety of UF’s campus and the norms by which they must conduct
themselves while on campus. Consequently, a robust communication strategy is in place
that will quickly and effectively guide persons to the appropriate information regarding
UF’s COVID-19 response and recovery efforts and provide assurances that UF is taking a
comprehensive approach to maximizing campus safety. Starting as early as January
2020, UF began executing a communications strategy around COVID-19, establishing a
variety of critical communications channels and implementing a communications
strategy for both internal and external audiences. This comprehensive communications
strategy also envisions a strong external partnership model to be deployed in off-campus
areas, as described in the above section on the “Healthy Campus Environment.”
All the while, UF is prepared to adjust its prevention and mitigation strategies related to
COVID-19 and other infectious diseases (including influenza) in response to any Florida 
UF Campus Reopening Plan Fall 2020 16
Department of Health directive. UF communications to our campus community will
reflect any changed imperatives regarding public health.
COVID-19 Virus Testing
One critical component of UF’s strategy focuses on the need to impact behavior change
around important healthy habits, slow the spread of the virus and foster a culture of
caring for our colleagues and our campus community. Undergirding the University of
Florida’s gradual transition back to full operations is a screen-test-and- protect program
involving COVID-19 screening of faculty, staff and students returning to campus. As UF
Health launches this expansive initiative, along with related campaigns focused on the
university’s mask/face covering and physical distancing policies and other healthy
practices, employees, students, and others will be returned to campus in a phased and
coordinated fashion. More information will be maintained and kept updated at:
https://coronavirus.ufhealth.org/screen-test- protect/.
Bringing our employees and students back to a safe and healthy campus setting is vital,
so plans to screen all faculty and staff (approximately 29,000 individuals this summer)
and test as appropriate prior to the end of June 2020 are well underway. As part of its
recovery effort, UF has expanded physical operations incrementally and after careful
review by university leadership. Colleges and units are determining the order in which
their employees return to UF work locations. The employee return to work process,
including screening and testing is then initiated (Appendix E). Testing is achieved at both
the university’s student health center and at a 10-station drive-thru site on campus—all
under the direction of UF Health medical professionals.
Just as with our faculty and staff, all students will be required to complete a screening
questionnaire. Also similar to our faculty and staff, some students will be subject to
mandatory testing. Based on current guidance from UF Health, the current plan for
student testing is:
Mandatory:
1. Screening questionnaire for all students (developed by UF Health)
2. Testing for all symptomatic students
3. Testing for all students in clinical settings (contact with patients)
UF Campus Reopening Plan Fall 2020 17
4. Testing for all students in research settings who have contact with human
subjects and cannot practice physical distancing
5. Students arriving from states listed in any then-applicable emergency order
from Florida’s Governor executive order (or internationally) must either
quarantine at their own expense for 14 days or be tested and cleared (free of
charge to the student)
Further, University Athletics may choose to make testing mandatory for athletes, and
other extracurricular activities may require mandatory testing at the discretion of the
leadership of those extracurricular functions.
Any student who becomes symptomatic will receive a COVID-19 test and be quarantined
if COVID-19 positive, and their contacts will be traced for exposure assessment in
accordance with the Department of Health rules and processes. As noted previously,
arrangements have been made with housing and service providers to quarantine
students, if needed. Students living in traditional residence halls will not be allowed to
remain in their regular campus residence during quarantine. Further, if any student tests
positive, Student Affairs staff will reach out to them and provide support based on the
student’s unique needs. This includes access to food, as well as connections to the
Student Health Care Center and Dean of Students’ Office for assistance with temporary
academic accommodations.
As part of its institutional recovery strategy, UF has well-established protocols with UF
Health to monitor the capacity of the local health care system as the university reopens
its campus. Daily hospital reports provide metrics concerning admitted COVID-19 cases.
As employees and students return in greater numbers, these metrics will be monitored
closely to ensure that health care capacity is sufficient to handle increased caseloads.
Meanwhile, UF’s Medical Guidelines and Protocol Team will coordinate its efforts with the
Clinical Advisory Committee’s recommendations in repopulating the campus at an
appropriate pace and scale.
UF is fortunate to have an academic health center associated with its enterprise and
stands ready to assist other SUS institutions with the development of a university
screening and testing plan.
UF Campus Reopening Plan Fall 2020 18
Contact Tracing and Surveillance
In consideration of the Florida Department of Health’s predominant authority concerning
contact tracing, UF remains ready to support tracing efforts as deemed necessary by
local, county, and state officials. In the meantime, UF will continue its efforts that include
screening, testing, and protecting the campus community through a variety of measures.
As UF works to restore full campus operations, all faculty, staff, and students are required
to complete an online screening questionnaire to determine if they have symptoms of
COVID-19. They also will be asked if they have had close contact with someone who has
symptoms or who has been diagnosed with the infection. Because some people can be
infected with COVID-19 and have no symptoms, nasal swab testing for COVID-19 is
available through the UF Health screening and testing process for any faculty, staff and
students to determine whether they are currently infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus
that causes COVID-19. This testing is offered at no cost to faculty, staff, and students.
These measures are robustly supported with efforts to clean facilities, to modify spaces
as needed, to provide face coverings, to promote hand washing, and to station hand
sanitizers throughout campus.
Because it hosts an academic medical center anchored by the UF Health Shands Hospital,
UF is favorably positioned to be well-informed concerning the rate of infection and
hospitalization related to COVID-19. Daily reports inform university leadership of the
status of the campus’ health environment. Furthermore, university leadership remains in
close contact with the Alachua County Health Department, staying apprised of cases
occurring within the county. UF relies upon the expertise and guidance of its
epidemiology officer in chief for the UF Health Shands hospital system, in collaboration
with UF’s other leading health experts, to identify triggers that may require tighter social
and behavioral restrictions.
Academic Program Delivery
There is great diversity across UF’s academic programs, including undergraduate,
graduate, clinical, laboratory and art, and remote/off-site programs. UF delivers
instruction through various means: face-to-face, hybrid, and online. Having invested
heavily over several decades to build its online and hybrid education infrastructure at the 
UF Campus Reopening Plan Fall 2020 19
undergraduate, graduate and professional levels, UF is a national leader in this area and
emphasizes quality in its production and delivery of course material.
Clearly, two critical metrics associated with education delivery are student retention and
success and time to degree. Our primary goals in designing the fall term instructional
configuration are: (1) to assure that as many students as possible can make appropriate
academic progress toward graduation; (2) to assure a safe environment and minimize the
risk of a significant flare-up of COVID-19; and (3) to assure the continued operational and
financial stability of UF if there is a significant flare-up of COVID-19. Consequently, fall
academic programming will be designed to accommodate as many students and faculty
as possible if they are challenged by serious illness, age, and/or serious underlying health
conditions that may put them at higher risk associated with COVID-19.
Under the provost’s leadership and with consultation from its deans, UF has conducted a
comprehensive analysis of the makeup of its face-to-face, online, and hybrid courses
across all domains: labs/arts, clinical, off-site, indoor, outdoor, non- traditional,
undergraduate, graduate, clinical, and professional in nature. Class sizes and delivery
formats have been considered and, in all venues, the appropriate combination of online
physical distancing, sanitation, masks, and other needed safety measures will be used.
The colleges will continue to work with the provost’s office throughout June to update
the course schedule for the fall semester in anticipation of students being asked to reregister in light of the changed environment. Guidelines to assist in accomplishing the
delivery of various types of classes will be available to deans, department chairs, and
faculty.
UF encourages its faculty to plan instructional activities to ensure continuity of education
in the case of COVID-19 flare-ups. The purpose of this plan is to help faculty and students
maintain, to the extent possible, the progress of teaching and learning in an environment
where in-person class sessions become inadvisable. The goal is to maintain the delivery of
instruction as much as possible to minimize the disruption of student progress. Faculty
will be encouraged to design each course syllabus to enable students to not return to
campus after Thanksgiving break, if they do not wish to do so.
Launched well before COVID-19 struck, a robust network of training and development
tools (available at https://elearning.ufl.edu/keep-teaching) has been made available to
support our faculty in the use of online and non-traditional modes of instruction
delivery—whether synchronous or asynchronous. UF provides ongoing training for
UF Campus Reopening Plan Fall 2020 20
faculty through a variety of channels, which include videos and online resources focused
on online teaching and research, on-demand workshops and consultations, and webinars
focused on specific technologies. In addition, UF faculty have access to online resources
for professional development, which include LinkedIn learning and vendor-provided
online content. UF has invested substantially in recent months to enhance the quality of
online courses that will be delivered this fall through close collaboration between faculty
and instructional designers. Co-curricular activities are a critical component of a wellrounded educational experience. Each college is developing plans for the co-curricular
experience to be as rich as possible, regardless of the method of course delivery or what
else might be happening on campus.
UF’s approach to recovery planning has been neither organizationally monolithic,
unidimensional, or inflexible. On the contrary, our reopening plan remains highly
adaptable and informed on many fronts. Eleven issue-oriented task forces continue to
provide input, as do the deans of all 16 colleges. The UF Faculty Senate provided input on
the plan. A draft was posted publicly, and input was requested and received from the
campus community at large through reopen@ufl.edu.
Since the inception of our planning efforts, we have seen demonstrable changes in the
health environment of our campus, our local community, and across the state and nation.
We are constantly monitoring these changes and anticipate more as we approach the fall
semester. We have made a point of regularly updating our campus community, with
emails, social media, Q & A web pages, and Town Hall meetings focused on COVID-19-
related issues. We have stressed the need to remain flexible and resilient to our faculty,
staff, and students (see a message from UF President Kent Fuchs here) and will continue
to do so. And, as with any emergency, we are prepared to modify our plans for the fall and
future semesters as this pandemic evolves.
