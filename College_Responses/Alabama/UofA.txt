A Letter from the President (Updated 8/12/20)
In June, I provided the campus with a draft report of my Advisory Committee for a Return to Full Operations.  Working in conjunction with the UA System Task Force, we established the cornerstones of our plan to return and our fundamental principles of planning.  Our timeline was ambitious – returning to campus operations with the beginning Fall 2020 semester, while adhering to appropriate health and safety protocols.
Throughout the summer, professionals across campus determined how we could accomplish the goals of continuing our mission and the value of the UA experience, while mitigating risks, protecting the community, safeguarding the vulnerable, and supporting the campus community to achieve at its highest level.  Academics reviewed their classes.  Facilities studied and modified our classrooms and other spaces.  Student Life innovated in order to preserve our experience in the “new” normal we faced.  Updates were provided to the community through frequent emails, communications and updates to healthinfo.ua.edu, through employee and student training protocols, and with posters, videos, and social media campaigns.
Today, I am pleased to provide this comprehensive update, summarizing those plans and communications, and establishing the necessary health and safety rules that will guide our return.  While #StillTideTogether, The University of Alabama can continue our indispensable role as a preeminent provider of education, research, and service.
We will continue to be nimble and responsive to changing circumstances, and I will notify you of any necessary changes as we go forward.  For now, let’s start the semester strong and plan to finish even better.

TESTING
Return Testing is Required for Faculty, Staff, and Students
Students must provide proof of a negative COVID test before returning to campus
This can be accomplished via the Guide Safe protocol (formerly Stay Safe Together), provided free to both in-state and out-of-state UA students, via a program funded by Governor Kay Ivey and coordinated by the UA System and UAB Medicine
Students may choose to use their personal physician for approved testing and upload those results via a portal at the Student Health Center’s website
Students who have had COVID in the past 12 weeks should not test, but should upload proof of that prior positive to the Student Health Center, while affirming that they served the required isolation period and have been symptom free for at least 10 days
Faculty and staff were provided free COVID testing by UA. Like students, all faculty and staff who plan to return to work on campus must have a negative test.  Only those who will continue to work remotely are excused from testing.
Sentinel and Routine Testing Will be Conducted, and Required for Some
Throughout Fall 2020, sentinel testing will be conducted to signal trends, identify potential outbreaks, and monitor the prevalence of COVID-19 in our community. This testing will be coordinated through Guide Safe and supplemented by UA.
Sentinel testing will involve a sample of approximately 4-5% of the community
Sentinel testing will be voluntary for most, but required for (i) students living on campus and (ii) students participating in intramural athletics or registered student organizations that hold in-person meetings of 10 or more
More information about the developing plans for sentinel testing will be published on healthinfo.ua.edu as Guide Safe finalizes details
Outside of sentinel testing, intercollegiate student-athletes, athletic staff, and those participating in clinicals must comply with required protocols for those areas
Symptomatic Testing Will be Available for All
Testing for symptomatic or exposed individuals (or cluster groups or locations) will be offered through the Student Health Center and University Medical Center
Testing for Faculty/Staff Transitioning From Remote Work (Required for Entry)
UA, UAH, and System Office employees transitioning back to work from a remote status will be tested before arriving on campus or at the System Office. UAB has communicated its testing procedures to its employees who are transitioning back. Any UA System employee who has already returned to campus must be accounted for in each campus’s sentinel process. UA System Office employees located on System campuses will be tested as part of the sentinel process for the campus on which they are located.

Student-Athletes, Coaches, and Athletic Staff  (Required)
UA System campuses will develop separate protocols to regularly test all students and employees participating in intercollegiate athletics. Testing protocols for these groups will be outside of sentinel testing, and must comply with all NCAA and host site requirements.  At a minimum, all staff and students actively engaging in intercollegiate workouts or competitions, whether formally or informally, must be tested at least one time per week.

Sentinel Testing (Voluntary for general campus population/Required for Specific Groups)*
Weekly sentinel testing will be coordinated through Guide Safe and supplemented by our campuses. Sentinel testing, which will target a randomized sample of 4-5% of the general campus population (collecting no less than 2.5% of the sample), will be used to signal trends, identify outbreaks, and monitor the prevalence of COVID-19 on UA System campuses. Sentinel testing is voluntary for most of the campus community, but is REQUIRED for students:

Living in on-campus residential housing (including Greek housing) • Participating in intramural club sports  • In registered student organizations that hold in-person meetings with ten (10) or more people  • Participating in clinical activities, provided that student also has or will have a presence on campus throughout the semester
“For-Cause” Testing (Voluntary for general campus population/Required for Specific Groups)*
UA System campuses will immediately respond to any suspected increase in COVID-19 exposures in a specific campus location or an identified group of individuals (“for-cause” testing).  Campus healthcare professionals will determine the need to perform for-cause testing when, in their medical opinion, there has been a notable increase in reported positive tests or COVID-related symptoms in a common geographic area or group of people. Students required to participate in sentinel testing must also participate in for-cause testing.  Those who refuse to participate in required for-cause testing will be referred to student conduct

TRAINING AND HEALTH CHECKS
Training is Required
Student training is required before return. Every student on campus must complete Student Information for Fall 2020, and distance students are encouraged to complete it.
Faculty-staff training is required before return. Faculty and staff working on campus were required to complete COVID-19: Infection and Prevention and Control and COVID-19: Employee Update for Fall 2020.  Employees working remotely are encouraged to do so.
For assistance:
If you did not receive the email link, you can access training via the UA-LMC icon inside myBama (“Employee” section for employees or “Campus Life” for students).
Learning plans are available at http://ualms.docebosaas.com
For questions or access issues, email CERA@ua.edu
Healthcheck Usage is Required for Return
All faculty, staff, and students working on campus are required to complete Healthcheck truthfully and daily.
Upon completion of each Healthcheck, you can access a clearance screen through the Guide Safe Event Passport function. Instructors and event organizers must use Passport to facilitate access to classes, campus and campus events.
Visitors, vendors, and attendees at athletic, fine arts, and other on-campus events must present Passport clearance for admission.
 

FACE COVERING/HYGIENE/PHYSCIAL DISTANCING
Face Coverings are Required
Face coverings are required:
In all UA facilities, with very limited exceptions
For indoor and outdoor academic or student events, including social events and events sponsored by University registered or affiliated organizations
Limited exceptions include
In your room/suite
Alone in an enclosed office or study room
Alone in your vehicle
Walking or exercising outside, while physically distanced
In indoor athletic facilities while actively participating in athletic activities
While actively participating in intercollegiate activities
When speaking to a crowd while maintaining social distance
Approved face coverings include masks, cloth face coverings, and face shields (in certain circumstances). Faculty, staff, and students have been or will be provided two cloth face masks.
 

Physical Distancing is Required
Physical distancing requires 6 feet of uninhabited space around you – all sides. Faculty, staff, students, and all others on campus must comply with physical distancing.
Plexiglas dividers have been provided in some classrooms and other areas where distancing is difficult or not possible
Practice Safe Hygiene
In addition to requirements of face coverings and physical distancing, faculty, staff, and students are also encouraged to follow proper handwashing and hygiene practices
UA has provided new touchless hand sanitizer stations throughout campus, and has upgraded cleaning protocols to assist in these goals
Supervisors have been instructed to continue remote and staggered schedules to allow for distancing and transmission mitigation

ACADEMICS

Academic Calendar. UA has adjusted the Fall 2020 academic calendar:
Fall Break will not be observed
In-person classes will end on the Friday before Thanksgiving. Classes will not be held Thanksgiving week, but will resume the following week, remotely.
Final exams will be remote
Content and Classroom Modifications
In order to provide for proper social distancing, modifications have been made to delivery methods and classrooms
Some classes will necessarily be remote. Even then, students will still have access to on-campus resources and to contact and questions with faculty.
The vast majority of classes (about 80%) will have significant face-to-face instruction:
Almost half will be in-person
Many will have hybrid delivery, such as rotating attendance
Some classrooms have been outfitted with plexiglas dividers, and furniture has been moved or removed from others to provide for social distancing. Furniture should not be rearranged in a manner that violates the rules of social distancing.
All courses will have remote components to ensure academic continuity in the event of changes, sickness, isolation or quarantine requirements
Classroom instructors must use the GuideSafe Passport function to ensure Healthcheck compliance for in-person classes and instruction
Libraries and Other Resources
UA Libraries are prepared to serve the students, while preserving social distancing and health environments
Academic resources, such as the UA Writing Center and tutoring, have enhanced remote options

STUDENT LIMITATIONS
COVID-19 will remain a concern.  Not all spread can be avoided, and attending events certainly increases your (and others’) chances of contracting the virus.  Online events remain first choice and outdoor venues are encouraged.  Physical distancing and masks remain requirements.

Large student events are prohibited. To protect against the spread of COVID-19, all large gatherings organized by or for a student or student organization are prohibited until further notice.  This includes band parties, swaps, formals, out-of-town and off-campus parties, and large social gatherings of any other kind.
Size limits will be enforced for student and academic events (e.g., invited speakers, socials, etc.):
Indoor events may include no more than 50 individuals
Outdoor events may include no more than 100 individuals
Attendance limits necessarily depend on the space that is scheduled, and may only allow for smaller gatherings
Off-campus student events are strictly prohibited, including those sponsored by, or on behalf of, students or student organizations
Student event registration and attendee lists are required – all on and off-campus student organization events, including virtual events and meetings, must be registered with the Office of Student Involvement. A detailed list of all attendees with contact information must be maintained by the organizer/host for 14 days.
Student organizations hosting events will be required to complete and pass with 90% proficiency the Event Smart training module or will be be asked to meet with the Office of Student Involvement prior to their first event
Events must also comply with state and local health ordinances
Except for seated meals, any food or beverages provided during an event must be individual grab-n-go options
Passport Use Required – event organizers must provide attendees with a link to the Guide Safe Healthcheck 24 hours in advance, and use it to facilitate attendance
The Provost’s office and UA Division of Student Life teams are here to help. Any exceptions to these rules must be approved by them in writing. Attendance for classes and athletic events are addressed in event-specific plans.  These rules will be strictly enforced.

ENFORCEMENT
All members of the campus community (faculty, staff, and students) must strictly adhere to the University’s Health and Safety Guidelines.  These include the following:

appropriate use of face coverings
practicing social distancing
restrictions on large social gatherings
The intent of these guidelines is to mitigate health and safety risks associated with COVID-19 to protect all members of our campus and surrounding communities.

To emphasize the importance of adhering to the University’s Health and Safety Guidelines, stringent sanctions and discipline will be administered for violations.   While the University expects all faculty, staff, and students will be responsible and compliant members of the campus community as we navigate this academic year, any individual who violates the health and safety requirements will be met with sanctions/discipline intended to strongly address the risks their behavior creates.

The following disciplinary measures for students, student organizations, and employees serve only as a guideline and may be adjusted as needed to properly address the severity of any situation.  Interim measures may be utilized to remove an individual or organization from campus.

Individual Students
Campus Return Requirements – To return to campus or campus activities, including class, students must complete COVID-19 Testing, COVID-19 Training, and enroll in the UA Healthcheck.  Failure to complete the COVID-19 Testing, COVID-19 Training, or enroll in the UA Healthcheck will result in being denied re-entry.

The Office of Student Conduct will oversee student violations.  Repeat offenders will face increasingly greater sanctions.  Egregious offenders will be met with significant sanctions up to and including suspension after as little as one offense.  Given the expectations for compliance and the need to mitigate risks, leniency in the implementation of sanctions will be limited.

The following is a general guideline for sanctions that, again, can be accelerated or modified as needed to address the specific situation.

First Violation— A letter will be sent to the student documenting the violation (e.g., failure to wear a face covering or practice social distancing) with a warning that future violations will warrant more significant action.  The student will be required to take additional health and safety training related to COVID-19.

Second Violation— The student will receive a formal conduct charge. If found responsible, the student will receive a written disciplinary warning, which will be reflected on their student disciplinary record.  The student will also be required to take additional health and safety training related to COVID-19.

Third Violation— The student will receive a formal conduct charge.  If found responsible, the student will receive disciplinary probation for up to two semesters and be required to complete the Capstone Character Workshop.

**All violations after the third violation may result in suspension for up to one year.**

Student Organizations
All students must comply with the rules related to events and gatherings.  Student organizations who violate these provisions will be sanctioned.  Similarly, if an improper event or gathering occurs that was not organized by a recognized student organization, conduct charges will be brought against individual students responsible for the event.  Repeat offenders will face increasingly greater sanctions.  Egregious offenders will be met with significant sanctions up to and including suspension after as little as one offense.

Key requirements related to student events include, but are not limited to, the following:

There will be no large student organized events. This includes band parties, swaps, formals, out-of-town and off-campus parties or large gatherings of any kind. The guidelines for indoor events are no more than 50 individuals, with no more than 100 for outdoor events.  Most importantly, attendance limits depend on the distance capacity of the space, so each event space is different and may not allow for even 50 individuals, depending on the ability to social distance within the space.  These restrictions may be adjusted, up or down, if risks associated with COVID-19 change.
Attendance restrictions for student organization events will be strictly applied, and all on-campus events, meetings, and programs held by student organizations must be registered through the Office of Student Involvement, including virtual events and meetings.
Student organizations hosting events are required to meet with the Office of Student Involvement and other campus partners before their first on-campus event.
All on-campus student organization events, meetings, and programs must be registered through the Office of Student Involvement. Event organizers must prepare plans to limit event attendance upon application for registration of a student organization event, including sanitation and cleaning plans. This includes, but is not limited to, the inclusion of a complete and exclusive list of planned event attendees.
Event organizers must also capture and maintain lists of actual attendees for potential contact tracing/public health use. Organizers must designate someone for this duty
Social distancing and mask wearing must be enforced.
Additionally, off-campus student events sponsored by, or on behalf of, student organizations are strictly prohibited, absent special approval from the Vice President of Student Life. Off-campus events, if approved, must also comply with all University, local, and state requirements.  

The following is a general sanctioning guideline for violations of the student event requirements:

First Violation— A written warning will be issued to the group and the group will lose the ability to host on or off-campus student events for a designated period of time. The group’s executive officers and advisor will be required to take additional health and safety training related to COVID-19.  Depending upon the seriousness of the violation regarding risk to health or safety, additional and more severe sanctions, including probation, more significant loss of privileges, or removal from campus may be imposed.

Second Violation— The student organization will be placed on probation and will lose its ability to host any events for at least the remainder of the semester.  The entire student organization and its advisor will be required to take additional health and safety training related to COVID-19.  Depending upon the seriousness of the violation regarding risk to health or safety, additional and more severe sanctions, including probation, more significant loss of privileges, or removal from campus may be imposed.

Third Violation— The student organization will lose all privileges for the remainder of the academic year.  To the extent the organization provides food service to its members, that—and only that—may continue.  Depending upon the seriousness of the violation regarding risk to health or safety, additional and more severe sanctions, including removal from campus may be imposed.

Fourth Violation— The student organization will be removed from campus for one academic year.


MAIN STATEMENT:
Ongoing Updates
As the situation related to COVID-19 evolves, the University’s protocols are subject to change.  Every effort has been made to ensure that the content in this update is as up-to-date as possible at the time of publication, but it is important for the University community to continually monitor official channels of communication including emails and the UA Health Info website.

Changes in Format or Schedule
In the interest of your health and safety and that of all UA students, faculty, staff, the University reserves the right to change the mode of instruction or schedule of delivery of instruction at any time, in its sole discretion, based upon prevailing public health and other guidance. This could include the transition from our planned methods of delivery including on-campus, hybrid, and remote classes and experiences to – if circumstances warrant – the exclusive provision of University services, classes, and other instruction or experiences on a remote basis, as practicable, or on an alternative schedule.

We are committed to maintaining the delivery of instruction to allow students to continue their education with minimal disruption, but the University cannot guarantee or promise to provide a specific mode of delivery of services, classes, instruction, or experiences, or that the mode of delivery will not change during the semester.  While the method of delivery may change, educational instruction and opportunities will continue. As such, the University will not provide any refund of tuition, in whole or in-part, based on a change in the mode of instruction or schedule of delivery of any services, classes or other instruction or experiences.

Acknowledgements
COVID-19 is an extremely contagious disease that can lead to severe illness or even death, and there is an inherent risk of exposure to COVID-19 in any place where people are present. Participation in on-campus educational programs and activities, on-campus work, clinical programs, or other campus activities may expose individuals to a risk of contracting COVID-19. Even if individuals and the University use all reasonable care, there is still a risk of exposure or infection while on University grounds or property, or while taking part in University activities or business.

The University of Alabama System and The University of Alabama have implemented rules, regulations, and protocols relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the continued, accurate, and timely use of the UA Healthcheck tool, submission to COVID-19 testing, the observance of social distancing guidelines, maintenance of personal hygiene requirements, use of personal protective equipment, cooperation with contact tracing, and compliance with isolation or quarantine requirements (“COVID-19 Health and Safety Rules and Requirements”).

Faculty, staff, and students must comply with all COVID-19 Health and Safety Rules and Requirements implemented by the University and University of Alabama System, currently summarized in this document, but which may be revised from time to time.

Faculty, staff, and students must notify their supervisor (for employees) or Student Health (for students) in the event that they (a) test positive for COVID-19; (b) show any of the CDC recognized symptoms of COVID-19; (c) become aware that they have been in close contact to a person that has tested positive for COVID-19; or (d) are advised to self-quarantine or self-isolate by a public health official or my medical provider, including any medical professional employed by or acting on behalf of the University. They must also accurately report such information in the UA Healthcheck tool. Faculty, staff, and students must not to return to campus until receiving written clearance from either Employee Health (for faculty and staff) or Student Health (for students).

Failure to comply with the University’s COVID-19 Health and Safety Rules and Requirements may subject faculty, staff, or students to discipline, up to and including the suspension or termination of employment, or suspension or expulsion from campus.
