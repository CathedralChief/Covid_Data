What you need to know:
Due to the damage and power outage caused by the Aug. 10 “derecho” severe thunderstorm, the start of Fall Term 1 classes has been delayed to Monday, Aug. 31.
Anyone entering a campus building or public space must wear a face mask and shield and consistently practice physical distancing.
The next academic year will consist of four 7.5-week terms, with an optional summer term. With limited exceptions, we will actively plan for the following groups to live and learn on-campus during these corresponding terms:
Fall Term 1: Small number of students approved for continuous residence, who will remain on campus for most or all the academic year (Aug. 31 – Oct. 21)
Fall Term 2: Mid-year graduates (Oct. 29 – Dec. 22)
Spring Term 1: First-year students (Feb. 1 - March 24)
Spring Term 2: Second- and fourth-year students (April 1 - May 25)
Summer Term: Optional term to meet academic needs that arise (June 7 - July 28)
We are planning for a very low-density campus this fall.
Fall Term 1and 2 classes will be offered remotely.
We must delay the arrival of first-year and transfer students to limit the number of students on campus.
We have a contract with a private testing firm for initial and regularized COVID-19 testing for students who will be on campus this fall.  
Off-Campus Study program (OCS) is suspended for fall.
Grinnell athletic teams will not compete against other colleges during the fall or winter seasons. 
FALL 2020 PLAN OVERVIEW
For the Common Good
Grinnell College has planned an academic year firmly grounded in the liberal arts and constantly informed by the latest medical information available on COVID-19. Over-populating a community introduces increased risk of transmission and is widely discouraged among epidemiologists, pandemicists and public health officials across the globe. Scientists agree that without testing, tracing, physical distancing and other prevention measures, it is impossible to stop COVID-19 until we reach herd immunity—probably months from now. While younger people are less at-risk of suffering from the virus, they do not have immunity and can unwittingly pass it to their families, faculty, staff and others in our community who are at greater risk. Fortunately, there are measures we can take that will allow us to guard against spread of the virus while welcoming students--in lower numbers than usual--to live on campus.

The first measure we are taking is to introduce a modified academic calendar consisting of four 7.5-week terms this year and an optional fifth term next summer. Of over 15 calendar variations we have considered with faculty, staff, students and administration over the last two months, we believe this calendar is the best aligned with a public health approach to planning. We are consulting a team of physicians and epidemiologists at the University of Iowa to develop a plan for testing throughout the year, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and social distancing strategies in academic, dining and common spaces.

Residency Plan
With limited exceptions, we will actively plan for the following groups to live and learn on-campus during these corresponding terms: 

Fall Term 1: Small number of students approved for continuous residence, who will remain on campus for most or all the academic year 
Fall Term 2: Mid-year graduates (Updated 9/14/20)
Spring Term 1: First-year students 
Spring Term 2: Second- and fourth-year students 
Summer Term: Optional term to meet academic needs that arise 
Throughout the academic year, wherever you are, you will continue to have access to the amazing resources that are part of a Grinnell education.

We have asked hard questions. We have looked at information from different perspectives and questioned our assumptions. We have listened to your questions and to community health experts, leading us to refine our plans. And we are creating an academic program—described in this video by two faculty members—that will engage you in new ways while staying true to the relationships and community values at the heart of a Grinnell education. We are excited about the year ahead.

S/D/F Grading Option
Students may elect the S/D/F grading option until the last day to withdraw for the term. Please note: the emergency S/D/F policy exceptions enacted for the Spring 2020 semester have expired and the regular S/D/F policy is in place for the 2020-21 academic year.

Physical Education Courses
The Physical Education Department is planning to offer credit-bearing physical activities for students online and on campus.

Major Requirements
In accordance with our goal of academic continuity, most of Grinnell’s fall course offerings have been retained. Requests for adjustments to major requirements will be addressed on an individual student basis.

Course Schedules
Course schedules for Fall Term 1 and Fall Term 2 are available online: refer to the Live Schedule of Courses for course times and locations. The schedules include filters for search course locations (i.e., on-campus vs. online). Individual student class schedules (what students are registered for) will be released on Friday, July 31.

Academic Support Services
Academic support services will be available to all students, regardless of their residency status. For example, the Writing, Reading, and Speaking Center will operate entirely online, and we will continue to provide Peer Writing Mentors for individual classes.

Remote Classes
We have gathered significant feedback from students and faculty on the spring semester and implemented changes based upon those experiences. We know that the coming year will bring new challenges, and so we will continue that evaluative process throughout the year.

In the spring, we had to pivot our courses rapidly from in-person to online. This happened in the middle of the semester, when much of the course design was already well underway. For the coming academic year, faculty already know which courses they will teach online, and are designing their courses with this in mind from the start. They are also taking workshops on best practices in online teaching, and learning relevant technologies that will enable them to lead dynamic, student-centered courses in this format. Our faculty and staff are continuously working to provide the best possible learning experience for our students, no matter where they find themselves in the coming year.

Classroom Enhancements
We are outfitting classrooms on campus with fixed and moveable cameras so that faculty will be able to record course content within the teaching spaces they know well. Every faculty member teaching an online course is receiving a college-issued microphone set to provide high-quality audio for live meetings and recorded videos. We are purchasing additional software and hardware to facilitate creative pedagogical approaches.

Student Support and Connections
Our highest priority for the year is to continue building connections with our students. We have reconfigured our course time slots to create multiple options for synchronous meetings across time zones. We will still have community events like convocation and performances, all online. Faculty will still hold office hours for each of their courses, and students will still have regular access to their advisers. Academic Advising and our Academic Resource Centers will remain open and will continue to support students with the same care and dedication, just virtually. We remain committed to pedagogical excellence and our individually-advised curriculum, and most of all, to you, our students.
