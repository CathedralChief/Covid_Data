As a guiding principle, the UI recognizes the more an individual interacts with others, and the
longer the interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread.      
The university’s Critical Incident Management Team (CIMT) is working to develop and disseminate
policies and processes for returning employees and students to campus with the goals of limiting
exposure to and slowing the spread of COVID-19.
To achieve these goals, the CIMT solicited and received detailed input from multiple stakeholders,
including UI and outside experts in medical and public health science; facility managers; research
administrators; emergency managers; educational specialists; and others. The policies and processes
developed by the CIMT represent its efforts to address multiple objectives, including a robust
educational experience and a campus with a reduced risk of COVID-19 infection.
The policies and procedures provided in this guidance were recommended to university leadership by
the CIMT, after consideration of all available input. These policies and procedures will continue to align
with policy decisions made by the governor and Board of Regents, State of Iowa.
The university will continue to follow the latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) and the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH), in consultation with UI experts.

CAMPUS HEALTH AND
DISTANCING PRACTICES
In order for the University of Iowa campus to resume
hybrid, face-to-face instruction, research, and discovery,
the following procedures will be implemented:
• Do NOT return to class or work if you are experiencing
any COVID-19 symptoms. Your own department
or college may have specific procedures for daily
attestations of wellness. In particular, no one should
come to work or class if they are beginning to
experience any of the following symptoms:
– Fever (temperature >=37.8C or 100.0 F)
– Shortness of breath
– Muscle pain
– Sore throat
– Chills
– Cough
– Difficulty breathing
– Headache
– Loss of taste or smell
• All students, faculty, and staff should follow the current
guidance from the CDC regarding quarantine and
isolation.
• If you come to class or work and begin experiencing
any possible symptoms of illness, you must leave as
soon as possible and inform your health care provider
and local HR leader.
• Unless otherwise indicated, applicable face coverings
(cloth covering, disposable or cloth mask, face shield)
must be worn by all building occupants unless they are
alone in a private office. All students, faculty, and staff
will be provided:
– 2 reusable cloth face coverings
– 2 disposable masks
– 1 face shield
• All university meetings, to the greatest extent possible,
will take place in an online format in order to maximize
the amount of available classroom space.
• Everyone entering a university building is expected to
follow CDC recommendations to reduce the spread of
COVID-19.
• Glove use is discouraged outside of recognized
infection or chemical control protocols in medical or
laboratory settings.
• Hand sanitizing stations (distributed and restocked
by Facilities Management) will be available at the
entrances of each university building.
• Hand sanitizer (distributed and restocked by Facilities
Management) will be available in each classroom.
• Cleaning supplies will be available to be used by
students, faculty, and staff within classrooms
(distributed and restocked by Facilities Management).
• Cleaning supplies will be available to be used by
students, faculty, and staff within unit assigned spaces,
such as offices, (distributed and restocked by unit).
Social Distancing
Social distancing is an important
tool in reducing COVID-19 droplet
transmission. In order to increase
social distancing, the UI will:
• Increase the use of remote work options for employees
who can work from home, adjust break and lunch
schedules, and stagger arrival and departure times,
among other strategies. Enhancing this practice will
reduce the number of individuals within university
buildings and on campus, in general.
• In coordination with individual departments, install
plexiglass dividers in areas where social distancing
cannot be practiced, such as public-facing offices, labs,
or studios. Procurement will be by the department.
• Implement social distancing practices both inside
buildings and on campus grounds. Common areas
(such as hallways, stairwells, entrances, and restrooms)
will be configured to allow for social distancing, with
appropriate signage.
• Outfit all classrooms with additional cameras and
audiovisual equipment to enhance the educational
experience.

Cleaning
The UI will follow CDC recommended
cleaning procedures for:
• High touch areas, public areas, and for equipment that
was used during an employee’s time working from
home.
• Surfaces or equipment used by the general public (such
as credit card terminals, fitness center equipment, etc.).
Such surfaces and equipment will be cleaned by the
user or a UI employee after each use.
• Areas known to be occupied by a person COVID-19
positive/presumed positive. The areas will be closed
off for at least 24 hours, if feasible. If more than seven
days have passed since the person was in the area, only
routine cleaning and disinfection is needed.
• Employees will be responsible for keeping their own
personal work areas clean, and students, faculty, and
staff will be responsible for practicing recommended
hand hygiene before using items that might be shared
by others, as well as cleaning items after use.
Protection for Populations
with Vulnerability
Certain populations are at higher risk to contract COVID-19
due to sociodemographic circumstances or have an
increased risk of morbidity and mortality due to age or
underlying health conditions. Additionally, members of the
UI community may live with others who are in vulnerable
populations. Students, faculty, and staff are encouraged
to speak with their health care provider and self-identify if
they have concerns regarding a medical vulnerability. Staff
and faculty can contact their local HR representative and
students can contact Student Disability Services. Strategies
to mitigate the risk to vulnerable populations include:
• Allowing remote work and remote coursework.
• Providing workspaces that minimize contact with others
(such as a single office or physical barriers).
• Encouraging students, faculty, and staff with
vulnerabilities to wear both a face covering and
face shield.
• Discouraging non-essential travel.
• Using online technologies for meetings and events.
Testing, Contact
Tracing, Isolation,
Quarantine
• Testing, both diagnostic and immunity, will be based
upon state and federal guidance and availability.
• UI will coordinate with Johnson County Public Health
(JCPH) on a unified response for contact tracing and
disease investigation for UI community members.
• Systems/technology will be explored and used to assist
with contact tracing.
• A concerted effort will be made to obtain current oncampus addresses and contact information for all
students to ensure timely communication in case of
testing notification or contact tracing.
• UI will consider assigned seating in classrooms in order
to aid contact tracing.
• UI will monitor local infection rates and disease
transmission among students, faculty, and staff to
identify groups, locations, and trends.
• Following guidance from JCPH and IDPH, UI will have
testing available to identify symptomatic cases and to
test close contacts of those with confirmed COVID-19
cases.
• UI will provide isolation space for students diagnosed
with COVID-19 who live in residence halls, and space to
quarantine close contacts as defined by JCPH. UI will
assist with transportation needs as appropriate.
• As appropriate, UI will provide resources to students
living off campus, as well as staff and faculty who are in
isolation or quarantine. 
GUIDING PRINCIPLES
• Placing people first as our university is only as strong as our students, faculty, and staff;
• Preserving and building on core values of excellence, learning, community, diversity, integrity, respect, and responsibility;
• Delivering world-class education, research, and health care; and
• Engaging shared governance and campus leadership

ACADEMICS AND THE CLASSROOM
In order for the University of Iowa campus to resume
hybrid, face-to-face instruction, the following campus-wide
procedures will be implemented, with individual colleges
creating plans to implement these procedures locally:
• Courses with enrollments of 50 or more students
will be moved to an online format. For courses with
a lecture/discussion or lecture/lab format, the larger
lecture section would move online, while the smaller
discussion/lab sections could remain in-person.
• Select courses that are prioritized for in-person
instruction and have enrollments of 50 or more students
will be evaluated to determine if appropriate classroom
space is available once classroom utilization capacity
standards are finalized.
• University classrooms will be outfitted with additional
cameras and audiovisual equipment to enhance the
educational experience.
• Unless otherwise indicated, applicable face coverings
(cloth covering, disposable or cloth mask, face shield)
must be worn by all building occupants unless a person
is alone in a private office.
• Where social distancing is not possible due to
permanently located equipment (e.g., lecture podiums,
pottery wheels) or specific course requirements (e.g.,
lab-based courses, clinical simulations), physical
barriers such as clear plastic panels between students
(and between students and instructors) should be
utilized.
• All colleges will need to collaborate with Classroom
Planning to ensure that as many spaces as possible
are available for instruction. This includes college
meeting spaces or instructional space that is under
college control.
• All university meetings, to the greatest extent possible,
will take place online in order to prioritize all space for
instruction (additional audiovisual equipment may be
required in those spaces; Classroom Planning and ITS
will develop appropriate plans).
• The university will utilize its existing grading system that
was in effect prior to the pandemic.
Remote Instruction
The Office of Distance and Online Education (DOE) and
the Office of Teaching, Learning, and Technology (OTLT)
have created a Remote Instruction Team. This team of
instructional designers, media staff, and teaching experts
has compiled best practices for teaching in online and
hybrid formats.
A new page will be added to the Keep Teaching at Iowa
website that will address the areas listed below. The
Remote Instruction Team is identifying and, when needed,
developing training that corresponds to each topic:
• Online/virtual course management and facilitation
• Creating and facilitating online assessments
• Effective online course structure
• How and when to conduct synchronous meetings
• How and when to conduct home recordings
• How to manage large courses
Support will be available in a variety of formats including:
• Individual consulting
• Workshops
• Online drop-in consulting or office hours
• Online support material (referenced above, will include
FAQs)
• ICON course templates
Additionally, the university will:
• Ensure each first-year student has at least one face-toface class.
• Support the development of teaching exercises to
accommodate social distancing in the classroom.
• Provide content on how to be a successful online
learner to first-year and transfer students via orientation
and Success@Iowa.
• Install additional cameras and audiovisual equipment in
every university classroom by fall 2020.

• Expand studio space in DOE, enabling instructors to
record lectures with support from DOE media staff
(support available from the UI Remote Instruction Team).
• Provide media check-out kits that will include portable
green screens, high-quality microphones, small lighting
kits, and web cameras for instructors to create their own
media content (support available from the UI Remote
Instruction Team).
• Provide TAs with training that supports online
instruction.
• With support from ITS, continue to improve the process
of delivering technology to students who are unable to
participate in online instruction.
University Libraries
Library staff, including student employees, will comply
with university and public health guidance regarding
density, social distancing, and protective equipment. UI
Libraries will retain an “online-first” approach to delivering
materials and services electronically whenever possible.
Online requests for print books and other physical
materials will be encouraged.
UI Libraries will prepare to reopen buildings to faculty,
students, and staff on Aug. 17, 2020, following these
procedures:
• Entry/exit:
– Signage will be posted outside entrances advising of
distancing and other measures to reduce the spread
of COVID-19.
– Sanitizing stations will be provided at all entrances
and exits.
– Where possible, foot traffic will be directed to
separate doors for entry and exit.
• Contactless transactions to circulate books and other
physical items:
– Physical barriers to at least 6 vertical feet will be
installed at designated service points.
– Signage, stanchions, and floor stickers will be
installed to direct queueing.
– Returned materials will be quarantined following
library best practices.
• Research consultations will be handled online (by
appointment only for Special Collections).
• Unrestricted (open) public spaces:
– Seating will be reduced and occupancy limited
following campus guidelines.
– Hours will be reduced to allow more time for
custodial staff to clean.
– ITS will develop a plan to create physical distancing
space between workstations for computers and
learning commons spaces.
– Appropriate social distancing will be marked in
buildings, among stacks, and in service areas.
– Signage to limit seating will be posted at tables to
maintain social distance.
– Public spaces that cannot be adapted to social
distancing will be temporarily repurposed.
• The following guidance will be adhered to for limiteduse spaces (enclosed rooms, etc.):
– One Button Studio and similar high-use spaces will be
reserved and used by a single person, with a cleaning
protocol implemented between appointments.
– Single-use study rooms, undergraduate and faculty
lockers, and other similar spaces will be limited for
social distancing; some may be unavailable for the
fall 2020 semester.
• Building modifications will be made in consultation with
Facilities Management and will align with university
guidance

Building Utilization and
Guidance
In coordination with colleges and central service units,
Facilities Management will develop and implement
building-specific plans for social distancing in common
areas (entrances, stairwells, hallways, restrooms,
etc.). Facilities Management also will develop overall
standards so that students, faculty, and staff can easily
recognize signage (developed with the Office of Strategic
Communication) and understand building operations
across campus. The following practices are examples of
actions that will be taken:
• FM@Your Service will serve as the primary intake
process to address questions and concerns raised by
employees. The questions and requests for information
will be directed to building coordinators for review
based on guidelines. As campus utilizes FM@Your
Service, a knowledge data set will be created to track
issues and concerns.
• The UI, in coordination with individual departments,
will install plexiglass dividers in areas where social
distancing cannot be practiced, such as public-facing
offices, labs, or studios. Procurement will be by the
department.
• Furniture arrangement, staggered staffing, or increased
remote work arrangements may offer options for social
distancing. Density or regularity of a space’s use can be
considered.
• Changes will be made to minimize surface contact in
buildings. These will include touchless door openers,
foot openers, and leaving doors open unless they need
to be closed for security/safety.
• Any changes will follow Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) and fire code requirements.
• Communal areas will be reorganized to permit 6 feet
of separation and the use of break rooms should be
minimized.
• Shared spaces should allow for 6 feet of social
distancing. In spaces where this is not feasible,
additional barriers (plexiglass, cubicle walls) should be
installed.
• Restrooms will be configured to support increased hand
washing as well as adequate fixture count to support
occupancy and code requirements. At the same time,
restroom occupancy should be set to allow for social
distancing in these ways:
– If a restroom has more than one entrance/exit,
one should be designated as an entrance, the other
an exit.
– In the case of a single entrance, building occupants
will be discouraged from congregating inside a
restroom or outside the hallway.
– Adequate restroom supplies will be provided,
especially soap and appropriate hand drying
methods.
– Personal items brought into a restroom should
be limited, with appropriate storage mechanisms
supplied (additional hooks will be installed where
applicable).
– Other recommendations for safe restroom
operations that reduce the spread of COVID-19
will be implemented. 

Cleaning and Disinfecting
• CDC guidelines for cleaning and disinfecting will be
followed.
• Frequent cleaning and disinfection of high touch
surfaces in common areas will be performed by
Facilities Management (plans are being developed by
building). Procedures for students, faculty, and staff will
be developed to clean classrooms between sessions.
• Cleaning and surface disinfecting for individually
occupied, unit-assigned spaces (e.g., office suites or
cubicles) will be required of individual occupants.
• Cleaning supplies to be used by students, faculty,
and staff at their convenience within classrooms will
provided by Facilities Management. (Individuals will be
responsible for cleaning their own areas when entering
a classroom).
• Surfaces or equipment used by the general public (such
as credit card terminals, fitness center equipment, etc.)
will be cleaned by the user or a UI employee after each
use.
• Areas known to be occupied by a COVID-19 positive/
presumed positive student, faculty, or staff will be
closed off for at least 24 hours, if feasible. Cleaning
and disinfection will be performed per CDC guidelines.
If more than seven days have passed since the person
was in the area, only routine cleaning and disinfection is
needed.
Accessories that could be handled by occupants should
be removed as much as practical (e.g. magazines,
pamphlets). Other miscellaneous items (e.g. decorations)
should be cleared and pens used for signing documents
