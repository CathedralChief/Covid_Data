Dear UVM Students, Faculty, and Staff,There have been a number of informational memos sent to students, their families, faculty, staff, and community members over the last several weeks as we prepare for our safe return to campus. In this memo, I am bringing together in one place the most current, critical information for you and providing links to webpages that contain greater detail:Campus Plan for a Safe Return: The University of Vermont submitted a Safe and Healthy Return to Campus Plan to the Governor on July 7 aligned with the state’s requirements for higher education. Our plan meets, and in many cases exceeds, the requirements set forth by the Governor.Fall 2020 Return to Campus Website: A comprehensive website has been created to serve as an ongoing resource for information related to the fall 2020 semester, as well as COVID-19 updates.COVID-19 Information and Service Center: A COVID-19 Information and Service Center has been established to provide a central source for information and support for all questions and issues related to COVID-19. The center will be located in the Davis Center. You can contact the center by e-mail at UVM.Strong@uvm.edu or by calling 802.656.1010.At-Home Option: To meet the needs of our undergraduate students who were unsure whether an on-campus fall semester was the right choice for them, an at-home semester option was developed. Students can continue to choose this option through August 30. First and second year students who have chosen the at-home option are only released from the fall 2020 on-campus residency requirement if they reside in their permanent residences this fall. Please remember, the intention of the at-home option was to be responsive to the health and safety concerns of students and their families and to de-densify the Burlington community.Testing Protocol: To support the health and wellbeing of our students and the broader community, we have provided free COVID-19 tests for students to administer at home, before they arrive on campus/in Burlington. The overall testing protocol includes:Pre-Arrival Test:    Day -5 2. See updated timing for testing of off-campus students in memo dated3. 8/22/2020, "On-Campus COVID-19 Testing Starts Monday."4. Arrival Test:          Day 0 5. (upon arrival either to move into a residence hall or, for those living off6. campus, the first day of classes) See updated timing for Day 0 testing7. of off-campus students in memo dated 8/22/2020, "On-Campus8. COVID-19 Testing Starts Monday."9. 10. Week-One Test:    Day 711. Weekly through September 18. At that point, UVMStrong will consider12. data and advice from our medical/epidemiology advisors and determine13. the frequency of testing going forward based on an analysis of the data14. generated by the earlier tests.Quarantine and Isolation: The Vermont Department of Health has created a useful graphic explaining the difference between quarantine and isolation.Pre-Arrival Quarantine - We developed a tool to help students and families determine pre-arrival quarantine requirements, and we supported students with an on-campus quarantine option.On-Campus Isolation - On-campus beds have been identified in a few of our smaller, standalone residence halls for residential students who may become ill. A care and isolation support process has been developed to ensure students receive medical assistance and necessary support (food, etc.) while in isolation or quarantine.A memo was issued to all students on August 10, 2020 sharing the Rules and Tips Surrounding Quarantine and IsolationContact Tracing: University personnel in the Student Health Center are trained and prepared to participate in contact tracing under the coordination of the Vermont Department of Health.?Green and Gold Promise: The Green and Gold Promise clearly articulates the expectations that UVM has for students to remain compliant with all COVID-19 recommendations from the federal Centers for Disease Control, the State of Vermont, and the City of Burlington.Sanctions for Non-Compliance: The Code of Student Conduct outlines policies that potentially relate to violations of the Green and Gold Promise. Sanctions for violations include fines, educational sanctions, parent notification, probation, and suspension.Daily Health Screening: All members of the UVM community must conduct a daily health check by taking their temperature and assessing symptoms prior to arriving on campus or entering a classroom, dining hall, or participating in any activity on campus. Employees will use a UVM web form to conduct daily screenings. The form will go live on August 12 and daily checks for employees will begin on August 13. Students will download a phone app, CoVerified, to conduct daily screenings.Mandatory Training: In compliance with directives from the Governor, all employees are required to complete mandatory training on COVID-19 health and safety requirements before they are permitted to return to their workplaces following remote work.Face Coverings and Other Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Face coverings are to be worn at UVM whenever you are in the presence of other people or in a public setting. UVM’s face covering guidance was developed to comply with Vermont’s Stay Home Stay Safe order, the Vermont Department of Health recommendations, and the Vermont Occupational Safety and Health Administration mandates. The University has established a process to provide and allocate other PPE including plexiglass shields, face shields, and gloves. Guidelines for PPE for students and faculty participating in clinical and research experiences requiring additional PPE have been established.Social Distancing: UVM will incorporate social distancing—a proven public health strategy— into all of its educational and co-curricular activities. Students, faculty, and staff are expected to observe strict social distancing of 6 feet while on campus. The occupancies of classrooms, labs, lounges, study spaces, meeting rooms, and other designated common areas have been adjusted so that students, faculty, and staff maintain strict social distancing of no less than 6 feet per individual.Classroom De-Densification and Cleaning: To support social distancing in classrooms, the fall 2020 schedule was revised to include four modes of instruction and reduce the physical presence of students in classrooms. All classrooms will be deep-cleaned on a nightly basis, and hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes will be available in all classrooms. Students and faculty will wipe down their seating or lecture area at the end of each class.Classroom Technology: UVM’s efforts to prepare for the fall semester include nearly $3 million in technological improvements intended to enable the four modes of instruction while maintaining public health and safety. UVM’s Enterprise Technology Services is executing a plan to equip most of the University’s 230 classrooms and a number of conference rooms with enhanced technologies to create highly flexible spaces. All the classrooms will be equipped with webcams with integrated microphones to avoid the need to share a handheld microphone. Teaching spaces will be equipped with a tablet that can serve as a substitute for a whiteboard on which faculty would normally write. Our technological improvements will make it possible for faculty to webcast their lectures, synchronously or asynchronously, with a live or remote audience. These improvements will make it possible for students to have meaningful virtual interactions with the faculty or other classmates.Residential Halls: In an effort to reduce the density in our residence halls, we created the at-home option, and we eliminated all triple and quad rooms from our housing inventory.Dining Halls: Indoor dining seating has been reconfigured to allow for social distancing, new touchless technology has been implemented, and dining spaces will be disinfected more frequently to increase safety. Additionally, outdoor dining seating has been created and dining options will be expanded to offer more flexible grab-and-go options.Off-Campus Student Conduct: Our Office of Student and Community Relations has been in ongoing communication with our students and responding to concerns raised by members of the neighborhood. A communication was sent to all off-campus students, outlining our expectations for behavior to ensure the health and safety of the community. We have also created a website to share health, safety, and accountability information with our Vermont neighbors.Curtailing Visitors: Students may have only two guests with them on move-in day. Guests must meet State of Vermont travel restrictions. UVM will limit any other outside visitors, and also will not allow visitors to residence halls after move-in is completed.Study Abroad: The global nature of this pandemic makes travel abroad risky on many levels; therefore, all fall 2020 study abroad and winter session travel programs have been cancelled. A decision regarding spring study abroad and travel study will be announced before November 1. If you have questions about fitting Study Abroad into a future semester, contact the Office of International Education.These measures demonstrate the University’s commitment to your health and safety as students, faculty, and staff. As one community, we must work together in furtherance of our mission to provide students with a high-quality educational experience. I acknowledge and thank the UVMStrong Committee and Working Groups, Staff Council, student leaders, union representatives, and the Faculty Senate for their contributions to our safe return to campus.I hope you will find this a helpful informational resource in preparing for the safe and healthy return to campus. We are committed to keeping you informed and will be providing future updates as necessary.Now, more than ever, we need to be aware of the impact our individual decisions have on our entire community. Each of us will play an important role in maintaining a healthy environment that will allow us to provide you with the in-person learning experience we value so highly.Below I have listed reminders of the most important actions you can take to support our collective health and safety this fall. These updates emphasize how important it is that we work together as a community. This week, faculty are using new instructional technology in their classrooms for the first time. Your professors have invested a great deal of time and energy in revising the structure and content of their courses to accommodate this unique semester, but there are certain to be some challenges early on. As we all adjust to these new ways of teaching and learning, I ask that you support this process by being patient, positive, and helpful. Be willing to work with faculty to problem-solve and connect with your fellow students. These times ask a lot of all of us, but this is a learning opportunity for both faculty and students.Personal TravelOnce you arrive on our beautiful campus, remaining in Vermont for the duration of the semester is critical. Here is some important travel information:Personal travel beyond Vermont is strongly discouraged until we recess for Thanksgiving break. If you do leave the state this semester, you will be required to observe the quarantine restrictions in place upon return.Personal travel is not an excused absence; your related quarantine will likely have a negative impact on your academic performance.If a family emergency requires your travel outside of Vermont, notify your Dean’s Office as soon as possible before departure; your Dean’s Office will work with your faculty members to ensure the continuity of your coursework during your quarantine upon return.Any essential academic travel will require the pre-approval of your Dean’s Office. Further information about that approval process is forthcoming.Face CoveringsFace coverings are one of the simplest and most effective methods of curbing the spread of COVID-19. You can do your part to create a safe community by wearing your mask, and also by reminding your friends to wear theirs. I have directed our faculty and graduate teaching assistants to set clear expectations for mask wearing in the classroom.Your professors cannot hold class if even one person is present without a mask. If you arrive in class without a mask, I have instructed faculty to tell you to leave class to retrieve a mask. We can all forget to put on our mask sometimes. If you see a fellow student in a public space without a mask, take a moment to remind them that masks are required on campus, even outdoors. Play it safe. Always have a spare mask tucked in your backpack (and remember to replace it if you need to use it); do not share reusable masks that have not been laundered since the last use.Faculty and staff members will vigorously enforce the mask requirement because we care about you and the health of our community.TestingYour response to the pre-arrival testing requirement has been outstanding—thank you. I know you will soon be busy with academic and co-curricular responsibilities but testing must remain a high priority. Make sure to build the few minutes it takes for your weekly test into your regular schedule. All students must receive negative test results before attending their first in-person class. The only students exempt from the on-campus testing protocol are:Undergraduate students who have elected the at-home optionGraduate students who have elected the remote optionGraduate students enrolled in internships, practica or field courses outside of Chittenden County who have worked with their placement coordinator, submitted the remote option form, and have been approved for the remote optionContinuing and Distance Education Students who have elected the at-home optionThird and fourth-year medical students enrolled in clinical placementsStudents who have been formally exempted from the testing process for other reasonsThe testing center in the Davis Center is open Monday to Thursday 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and Fridays 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Be sure to schedule your next regular test seven days after you last test using the CoVerified App.Please review the comprehensive testing information located here.Testing is about the health of our whole community. Because we care about you, your fellow students, faculty, and staff, students who do not complete the required testing will be subject to fines and other disciplinary measures.Hand Hygiene and Six Foot DistancingGood hand hygiene and practicing 6-foot social distancing are simple and effective practices that can help slow the spread of COVID-19. I know you are excited to see your friends and classmates and that you want nothing more than to socialize after a long five months apart. If you want to be together, for a safe in-person semester, show you care about your friends by gathering safely.Wash your hands frequently; use hand sanitizers throughout the day; and keep your hands away from your face.Practice 6-foot social distancing in the classroom and all other public places on campus.Do not allow guests into you residence hall, or your residence hall room.Observe the off-campus gathering limits as determined by the Governor and Mayor.Green and Gold PromisePlease think deeply about the Green and Gold Promise throughout the semester. This is not simply a requirement that must be completed before classes begin—this reflects your ongoing commitment to our community.Unfortunately, we do not know how long we’ll be wrestling with pandemic conditions. If we all commit to this new normal, which I recognize will require sacrifices, we can achieve a successful campus reopening and serve as a model for the rest of the nation.
