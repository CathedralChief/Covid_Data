After much discussion, we have decided to begin the fall semester on Tuesday, August 18, one week earlier than planned. We will then move into an accelerated push through the semester to an early end with a return home for Thanksgiving break and remote exams to complete the semester. The number of teaching days will not be affected by these changes. NVU Online will start as planned on August 31 and continue with its normal schedule.We have set up process and procedures for check-in and return to campus. Check-in/Move-In and Testing procedures must be followed to return to the Johnson and Lyndon campuses this fall. Please read the material in the dropdown menus for detailed information on your return to NVU — including check-in, COVID-19 testing, masks on campus, course delivery, and frequently asked questions.As of October 20, 3,849 tests have been taken with 1 positive result. The tests were conducted through the Broad Institute testing program.Through the remainder of the semester, testing will continue bi-weekly with a random selection of faculty, staff, and students. Those identified will receive email instructions about where and when. Please send questions related to testing to Jonathan Davis.It is mandatory for all students, faculty, and staff who are on an NVU campus to do a daily symptom screening. Students, faculty, and staff will self-attest on days that they will be on campus. Students will complete this form 7 days a week.Masks are required on our campuses.At this time, I want to reassure you that this is one positive case out of 3,849 tests over the course of the semester. We have prepared for this and have taken appropriate action.The NVU community has done an incredible job adhering to health and safety guidelines during this pandemic. We must keep this vigilance up in wearing masks, keeping social distance, and washing hands, especially as we move inside as the weather turns colder. We cannot let up.This positive case reinforces how incredibly important it is for our students to stay put during the next week’s two-day break. Vermont is surrounded by counties that are now considered unsafe for all but essential travel. Please, do not travel. Stay on campus or at home if you commute. We made this decision to support you, and we must ask that you support the full NVU community by doing all you can to keep members of the community safe. Strict adherence to the Vermont cross-state travel guidelines will be required, as it always is. Once the Vermont Department of Health begins their work, they will be in touch with anyone who needs to be notified. If you are called by their contact tracing team, please answer the call—this is to protect your health and to contain spread of the virus.
