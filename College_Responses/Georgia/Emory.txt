Academic Experience
Our intention was to bring all members of our community back this fall for in-person learning, but the current COVID-19 conditions in our region prevent this option.

Classes
On-Campus Classes 
Undergraduate, on-campus classes are limited to those who must take an in-person class to make meaningful progress toward graduation in the coming academic year (predominantly seniors), select first-year seminars, and a small number of courses that mandate in-person labs, performance and studio time, academic research, or necessitate campus-specific library access.   

Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors  
Students not included in the categories listed above have remote-only learning this fall, and they should stay where they are and not travel to Atlanta for the fall semester. This decision will be revisited for the spring semester and will be contingent upon a decrease in COVID-19 prevalence in Atlanta and the ability of Emory community members to practice safety measures this fall.

Remote Learning Offered to All 
All faculty and students may elect remote academic options, and in this regard, we are encouraging everyone to make their own decisions for their Emory fall semester experience.  

Student Experience
The Emory University campuses look very different this fall. We are disappointed that we all can’t be together on the Atlanta and Oxford campuses, but we look forward to the time when we can, and we are thankful to have a resilient, connected community.

Emory University has reduced the number of students allowed to live in residence halls and take in-person classes this fall. We will still deliver a first-class education to all students but will do so in ways that allow us to maintain community health for faculty, staff, and students. 

Housing and Dining
Students who have an approved housing contract for the coming academic year and fit into the following categories: first-year and new transfer students, international students, undergraduate students receiving scholarships as part of a scholarship program specifying on-campus housing as a condition of their scholarship, and students with specific on-campus housing needs, pending review and approval, may live on campus. 

Not all residence halls or buildings will be used this fall, with student population and available restrooms determining use. 

Those students with a housing contract and who fit the categories listed above will receive further communications outlining their housing assignment and meal plan options and pricing.  

Move In 
Residence hall move in will occur August 13–17, and students will receive further information on their specific date and new move-in procedures.   

Campus Life
Student-Led Programming and Greek Life 
All undergraduate and graduate student clubs and activities, including fraternities and sororities, will be held virtually for the fall semester. Off campus events will not be allowed and travel associated with student groups will be prohibited. Campus Life will be working with these organizations to ensure they continue to thrive during the fall semester and that all students have access to the Emory community.

Alumni Mentors
The Oxford and Emory alumni network is a great resource for you as you explore your professional pathways and provides an opportunity to connect to other Emory graduates. Alumni can be helpful in serving as mentors, locating internships or volunteer opportunities, conducting informational interviews, or finding other points of connection. We encourage you to visit  EmoryConnects, fill out a profile and begin your lifelong professional connection with Emory’s global network.

Intercollegiate Athletics and Club Sports 
Emory University will not have competition for Division III athletics, club sports or intramurals through January; this Division III decision aligns with a recent announcement from the University Athletic Association.  

Emory will also restrict practices for all teams until public health conditions allow for safe participation for all our student-athletes. Students should not return to Atlanta this fall solely for intercollegiate athletic or club sport opportunities. 

I General Health and Classroom Safety
The university provided general guidance on campus health and safety on the Emory Forward website:
http://www.emory.edu/forward/on-campus/index.html. In addition, the university has outlined five
general guidelines to promote safety on campus and in the classroom.
Action: Ensure that all faculty and students are aware of these campus and classroom safety guidelines.
Review and modify school conduct codes to address serious, pervasive, and/or repeated PPE-related
conduct problems. Publicize changes to the code.
 Guidelines
● Everyone must practice the 3 Ws: Wear a facial covering on campus; Watch distance-- be 6 feet
apart; Wash hands or use hand sanitizer often.
● Everyone must wear a facial covering anywhere on campus, even outdoors. Exceptions are when
eating, and when faculty or instructors are alone in their personal office. Eating should be done
in an approved indoor Dining Services location, outside and with ten feet of distance, or alone in
a personal office.
● Everyone must maintain six feet of distance anywhere on campus, even outdoors. Eating outside
should be with ten feet of distance.
● Eating and drinking are not permitted in the classroom or in laboratories used for instructional
space.
● When teaching, instructors must follow the two-factor PPE protocol. Consensus guidance from
CDC and Emory Environmental Health and Safety Office is to have two elements of protection.
o face mask/covering + 6’ of distance
o face shield + an acrylic barrier
o face shield + at least 8’ of distance
o Face covering + face shield (can be used to approach students for short one-on-one
conversations)
2
● The Faculty Toolkit has additional guidance on classroom logistics and the two-factor PPE
protocol: http://cfde.emory.edu/resources/teaching/faculty-toolkit.html#safetypolicies.
● Videos are available that are available for students, faculty, and instructors that review
classroom health and safety protocols:
o Students: https://vimeo.com/446858006
o Faculty and instructors: https://vimeo.com/443344766/b49fc205ef
Instructor Authority and Conduct Code
● Faculty have the authority to ask a student to leave the classroom if the student is not practicing
physical distancing or wearing a facial covering. See Community Compact.
o The Emory Compact Response Team (ECRT) is responsible for reviewing reports of
compact violations submitted by the community. The ECRT will provide support to
enable community members to better follow compact expectations and will administer
appropriate sanctions for violations of compact expectations. Reports to the ECRT are
made using a link on the Emory Forward Our Responsibility page.
● Serious, pervasive, and/or repeated violations of the compact are grounds for a disciplinary
review and action by the school or college Student Conduct authority. The ECRT will refer these
types of problems to the appropriate student conduct office. Schools and colleges should review
and modify conduct codes to include these types of PPE-related conduct problems.
o Definitions, potential violations, procedures, and actions should be clear.
o PPE-related conduct problems should be addressed as part of the code, made public
along with the compact, and communicated to faculty, students, and staff.
● Violations of health and safety guidelines by faculty, instructors, or staff are addressed by
Human Resources.
II Class Schedules and Classroom Standards
The university adopted a set of space standards to help promote health and safety in the classroom.
These standards are outlined below with more detailed information available at: [need link to where
document will be posted]. Some programs have learning activities that require specialized space. Work
with the Environmental Health and Safety Office (EHSO) to develop a space plan for these activities.
Action: Ensure that all faculty and staff are aware of space and scheduling requirements for classes and
other learning activities. Collaborate with EHSO to develop space plans for specialized needs. Ensure
that school facilities staff work closely with Campus Services on physical space setup.
Class length and scheduling
● Make every effort to schedule classes at the preferred maximum of 75-90 minutes.
3
● If a program curriculum requires classes or other learning activities that are longer than 90
minutes, schedule breaks of at least 15 minutes at regular intervals to allow students to leave
the space.

● When possible, change rooms after 90 minutes or longer intervals.
● Schedule 25-minute intervals between classes to clear the classroom and prevent entering and
exiting students from crossing paths inside of buildings.
Class size limits
● In-person class size is limited to no more than 35 students, with most classes expected to
be under 30.
● Schools may request rare exception to that limit by providing a pedagogical justification and a
specific and detailed contingency plan to move to a smaller class size if public safety
considerations demand. In instances where exceptions have been approved, classes must not
exceed 50 individuals.
● Send requests for class size exceptions to Mike Andrechak
(michael.j.andrechak@emory.edu) for review.
Classroom space configuration
● For traditional classrooms and lecture halls, 50 square feet/person is used to determine
maximum occupancy and seating layout. Campus Services and school facilities staff measured
and verified all classrooms to confirm maximum occupancies.
● Define an “instruction/teaching zone” by floor tape in front of the classroom or lecture hall
demarking 6ft from the first row and when applicable a second demarcation 8-10ft from the
first row.
● In rooms with fixed furniture, show approved seating with visual cues/markings.
● In rooms with moveable furniture, clearly mark where chairs should be located. Chairs are not
to be moved from these locations.
● When students are wearing face coverings and the instructor is wearing a face shield (without
a cloth face mask), an acrylic barrier is needed if the distance between the instructor and
nearest student(s) is less than 8-10ft.
● To allow for one-on-one instructor/student conversations before or after class (when both
faculty or instructor and student wear a face covering) an acrylic barrier should be placed
around the lectern since physical distancing cannot be achieved in close conversation. Tents
provided outside of classroom buildings will be available for such uses. Guidelines will be
provided.
Athletics, Physical Education, Exercise, and Recreational Facilities
4
● All athletic, physical educations, exercise, and recreational facilities will be closed at the
beginning of the Fall 2020 semester. Should changing circumstances allow these facilities to
open, the following space guidelines should be followed.
● A 150 square feet/person metric is used to determine maximum occupancy in athletic, physical
education, and recreational facilities.
● Physical distancing requirements are doubled (12ft between individuals) due to higher
droplet/aerosol generation. In some cases, duration of activity, acrylic barriers, and/or training
outdoors may be used to reduce physical distancing requirements. Consult the Environmental
Health and Safety Office for specific case scenarios.
● Maintain physical distancing in locker rooms and equipment rooms at 12ft apart. If it is
impossible to ensure equipment is 12ft apart, use of acrylic barriers may be appropriate.
● Olympic pool occupancy must be limited to 3 swimmers per lane (swimming in a circle).
Swimmers should be prohibited from passing within the same lane when swimming in the same
direction.
III Faculty Absence
Faculty members may be absent throughout the course of the semester as a result of illness or
quarantine. Exposure to COVID may result in multiple instances of quarantine or lengthy absence.
Action: Ensure that all faculty and staff are aware of procedures for reporting illness. Establish a process
for responding to reports of faculty quarantine or isolation. Develop a school-wide plan for managing
faculty absence.
Illness
● Faculty, instructors, and staff who are symptomatic should call the COVID-19 hotline (404-712-
6843) for evaluation and instructions about testing.
● Faculty, instructors, and staff who test positive for COVID-19 from another testing facility (i.e.
public health facility, doctor’s office, etc.), must report the positive test result by calling the
Office of Injury Management (OIM) at 404-686-8587. OIM will provide instructions about next
steps.
● The Office of Injury Management supports the return to work process after faculty illness.
● The university has developed communication protocols for informing others of faculty or
instructor illness. The protocols will be distributed when finalized as part of a broad
communications effort. Identify the school leaders and administrative staff who will implement
the communication protocol.
Absence
● All academic programs and departments must identify, for every course, a faculty member or
instructor who can serve as instructor in case of an illness that prevents the faculty member or
instructor from teaching in person or if teaching remotely is not an option. 
5
o The backup faculty member or instructor must have the proper qualifications and
experience to teach the course.
o Graduate teaching assistants or associates cannot provide backup instruction in addition
to their other teaching assistant duties.
● Schools and programs must develop a set of criteria for determining when a ‘backup’ faculty
member will assume responsibility for instruction and communicate these criteria to faculty.
o Any class sessions cancelled because of faculty illness, quarantine, and/or isolation must
be made up prior to the end of the semester. For those schools who allow a set number
of cancellations per semester, any cancellations above that number must be made up
prior to the end of the semester.
● Departments/schools must keep records of any backup faculty or instructor assuming
instruction for a course and provide this information to the Office of the Provost at the end of
the semester.
IV Student Absence
The university has established a detailed action plan for student quarantine and isolation that addresses
needs for undergraduate, graduate, and professional school students. At the core of the plan is a wraparound service model where students will receive academic, mental health, and spiritual support during
quarantine and/or isolation. Critical to the success of the wrap-around model is that faculty and staff
are aware of its elements and are prepared to address students’ academic needs. Key elements are
presented below.
Action: Ensure that faculty, instructors, and staff are aware of the CARE plan and prepared to assist
students who are in quarantine or isolation. Communicate both general and school-specific procedures
for addressing student illness and absence.
Illness
● Students may inform faculty, instructors, or staff that they are feeling ill, have been diagnosed
with Covid19, or have been asked to go into quarantine. Faculty, instructors, and staff should
take the following actions:
o Inform students that they must notify Emory Student Health through the Student Health
Portal: https://login.emory.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Redirect/SSO?execution=e1s1
o Complete the Student of Concern Form and flag COVID. This will send information
directly to the relevant academic support office.
● Establish a response model that gives priority to students who are ill and in isolation as their
circumstances may be challenging and options more limited.
o Implement college- and school-based elements of the communication plan to ensure
that faculty, instructors, and staff know where to find the Student of Concern Form and
how to complete it appropriately.
6
● Establish guidelines for faculty and instructors should the extent of student illness and
quarantine impede class progress for the remaining students in the class.
o Communicate guidelines to faculty and instructors.
● Review school policies for medical withdrawal grades and make any modifications needed to
respond to the COVID context.
o Communicate any modifications to faculty, instructors, students, and staff.
● Identify and publicize any required actions for resuming academic activity when students return
from illness.
Maintaining academic progress
● In the context of COVID, faculty and instructors need to take attendance so that we can have a
record of whether a student is attending class. This will help us support students across the
different systems of the university and help with contact tracing.
o When students engage in classes asynchronously, Canvas or other learning management
systems can be used to evaluate student engagement.
● It is also important that we provide flexible attendance policies so that students who become ill
or are asked to quarantine, do not become even more stressed about having to miss
class. Faculty and instructors who include attendance as part of the grade must put an explicit
statement on their syllabus about how they will relax this policy for students who are required
to isolate or to quarantine.
● All class sessions must be recorded. Recording via Zoom saved to the cloud is recommended, as
this automatically generates a transcript; Echo 360 and Panopto are also options. Recordings
should be made available to the class via Canvas and must not be publicly available due to legal
issues related to student privacy. Requests for exemptions to this policy should be discussed
with the Dean (for example, if class discussions cover particularly sensitive topics).
● Review school policies for incomplete grades and make any modifications needed to respond to
the COVID context.
o Communicate any modifications to faculty, instructors, students, and staff.
● Provide guidance to faculty and instructors on flexible exam practices. Best practices include
avoiding synchronous online examinations and including a syllabus statement if webcam
monitoring is needed for proctored exams.
● Review recommended syllabus statements (http://cfde.emory.edu/resources/teaching/facultytoolkit.html#syllabuslanguage) and modify as needed to reflect specific school requirements.
o Communicate any modifications to faculty and staff.
V Academic Advising
7
We expect an increased need for academic advising for students enrolled in both in-person and on-line
classes. Students will experience many challenges and all schools and programs must be prepared to
address a wide range of student concerns.
Action: Ensure that you have adequate resources to provide prompt and accurate information to
students seeking academic advising. Collaborate with Campus Life and Student Health Services as they
organize and execute the wrap-around student service model for students who are ill or in isolation.
● Review service protocols and make modifications to allow support to be provided in a remote
environment.
o Provide any necessary training to help staff and peer advisors work remotely.
● Given the high levels of stress and the multiple challenges reported by students in the Spring
2020 move to remote learning, advising and other academic support units should aim to
acknowledge requests within 24 hours during the weekdays and ideally provide a response
within two to three business days.
● Follow the Academic Support protocol developed to support students in isolation or quarantine
as their circumstances may be challenging and options more limited.
o Do the weekly academic welfare check with students in isolation or quarantine.
o Be sure that the academic support programs follow the wrap-around service guidelines
established in collaboration with schools and colleges. The guidelines document will be
shared separately when finalized.
● Some students are dealing with mental health issues, and these issues may be worsened by the
pandemic situation. Develop a communication plan that informs faculty and staff of
recommended responses to student stress:
o Referral to Counseling and Psychological Services
o Complete the Student of Concern Form which will alert relevant offices to concerns
o Reminder that mental health issues are considered private medical information and we
cannot ask directly about these conditions.
▪ We can ask explicitly if students would like assistance in seeing a counselor or
talking with a professional about their stress.
VI Access to Online Learning from Campus
Students who do not live on or near campus may not have enough time between in-person classes and
online classes to return home and access the internet. Tents, library spaces, and the student center will
have dedicated spaces for online learning. Added spaces may be needed.
Action: Identify spaces, if needed, that meet all health and safety guidelines that will allow students to
engage in remote learning while on campus. Post signage and communicate the locations of learning
spaces to students and academic advisors.
8
● Use 50 square feet/person to identify maximum occupancy and seating layout for space to
be used for online learning. Due to variances in room configuration and furniture placement
limitations, Campus Services and school facilities staff should measure and verify all spaces
to confirm maximum occupancies.
● Arrange and mark chairs and furniture to make sure that students are at least 6 feet apart.
● Consult with the Environmental Health and Safety Office on location and space
configuration.
● Provide sufficient access to electrical outlets and other technical requirements to support
online learning.
VII Suspension of In-Person Learning
Given the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the recurring strain on Emory Healthcare and
other local medical resources, the university may face a need to suspend in-person learning at some
point during the semester. The university has provided in-depth guidance to support the design of
flexible courses: http://cfde.emory.edu/toolkit/index.html .
Action: Develop a response plan that draws upon lessons learned in the Spring 2020 implementation of
remote learning. Provide guidance to faculty, instructors, and staff that will allow a prompt and
effective response to a need to suspend in-person learning.
● If pandemic virus transmission increases mid-semester, it is critical that faculty and instructors
remain accessible and responsive throughout any suspension of in-person learning. Students
reported challenges in Spring 2020 as a result of lack of response from faculty and instructors.
Faculty and instructors should aim to acknowledge communications from students within 24
hours on weekdays and respond to concerns within two business days.
● Faculty and instructors of in-person and blended courses should design their course to be
flexible should students be required to leave campus mid-semester.
o Specific expectations for course design should be communicated to all faculty and
instructors.
● If severely changing circumstances require modification to courses, faculty and instructors
should aim to make those modifications quickly, maintain approximately the same amount of
work, prepare and post a modified syllabus, and then keep the syllabus stable for the rest of the
semester.
● Suspension of clinical rotations or community-based instruction is a serious barrier to academic
progress for professional school students. Academic programs that require in-person clinical or
community-based training should:
o Develop contingency plans that will support continued learning through alternative
formats within any constraints imposed by professional accreditation and licensing
bodies.
o Outline modified timelines to graduation and professional licensure.
9
● Suspension of research will be guided by a separate process and follow principles and actions
applied during the Spring 2020 semester
