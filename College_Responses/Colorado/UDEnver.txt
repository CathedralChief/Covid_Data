The University of Denver’s vision is to be a great private university dedicated to the public good.
The unprecedented challenges of COVID-19 provide us with an opportunity to lean deeply into
our vision – taking precautions to care for our own as well as one another’s health and well-being
while we support advancement of the public good through education, research, scholarship,
creative work, and service. For the last four months the University worked to maintain a clear
understanding of public health orders issued as a result of the pandemic and to articulate and
manifest both individual and collective responsibility on our campus. In this comprehensive
document, we provide our fall return to campus framework produced after very careful
consideration and deliberation by 10 Task Forces, multiple working groups, and individuals with
relevant expertise charged with different dimensions of this ambitious undertaking. This living
document will be regularly updated as we work alongside and are guided by our health partner,
scientific leaders, and federal, state, and local public health guidance and state and local public
health orders. We look forward to a safe and healthy return of on-campus living, academics and
co-curricular experiences for our students, faculty and staff this fall.
Guiding Principles & Values
The University of Denver is committed to a proactive, inclusive, and supportive response to
COVID-19 that honors our vision as a private university dedicated to the public good. Beginning
with our first decision to recall students who were studying abroad and moving through lifting
finals and then spring courses online, we have maintained a commitment to the safety of our
students, staff, and faculty, to excellence in the educational experience, and to our community’s
health and wellbeing. We moved quickly and effectively online – maintaining many aspects of our
high-touch teacher-scholar model -- with the deep engagement of faculty and students. Because
an in-person class experience resonates with our community and core mission, we have worked
diligently to prepare the community to return in the fall with adaptations that prioritize health,
safety, and well-being while on campus. We continue to refine these plans with the thoughtful
input of our task forces, the deep engagement with scientific and industry insights, with the
guidance of our health partner, National Jewish Health, in collaboration with other higher
education institutions in Colorado, and following federal, state, and local public health guidance
and state and local public health orders. The most up-to-date information, additional supporting
documentation, and FAQs which are broadly relevant can be found at the University’s COVID-19
website, and information specific to our internal community can be found on our COVID-19
Portfolio page.
Health, Safety, & Wellbeing
While it is not within the University’s power to prevent cases of COVID-19, DU community
members can help limit the number of potential cases and help control any potential spread by
supporting the University’s efforts via careful and frequent symptom monitoring, manual and
digital contact tracing, testing and prevention practices and behaviors.

Health Partner
The University is establishing a partnership with National Jewish Health, a not-for-profit academic
health center and the #1 ranked respiratory hospital in the U.S. After a lengthy review process,
we selected NJH to serve as our strategic partner as we develop, refine, and deliver monitoring,
testing, isolation, and contact tracing protocols for the DU campus. Founded 120 years ago, NJH
today is the only facility in the world dedicated exclusively to groundbreaking medical research
and the treatment of children and adults with respiratory, cardiac, immune and related disorders.
The expertise that NJH brings to the DU partnership is broad and specific to our needs. They
have established new acute respiratory clinics and respiratory recovery clinics for COVID‐19
patients and have launched new lines of investigation to understand the mechanisms of the
disease and the frequency of and risk factors for transmission. NJH’s world‐renowned
Occupational Pulmonary Medicine Program addressing exposure-related diseases, their
Respiratory Infectious Disease Program that specializes in diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary
pathogens, and their Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory, have established an approach to assist
with “back to work” programs for organizations across Colorado and around the country. We also
look forward to an opportunity to expand clinical, research, and academic program collaborations
between our two institutions that are already underway.
In addition, NJH has a range of affiliations with other health care systems and hospitals in our
region that rely on NJH’s world-class expertise for critical care assistance. We are proud to have
National Jewish Health as our partner to help guide us through this pandemic in the safest and
most effective way.
Testing
We will be partnering with National Jewish Health to flexibly apply the best COVID-19 testing
type, population, and frequency for the safe return of DU’s students, faculty, and staff to campus.
This very dynamic research and clinical environment provides a number of options to consider,
and those will be vetted thoroughly and implemented with the most up-to-date medical and
epidemiological expertise available.
Contact Tracing
Effectively limiting spread from any potential COVID-19 cases requires aggressive contact tracing
following a reported positive SARS-CoV-2 test or COVID-19 diagnosis. Initial determinations of
where SARS-CoV-2 positive have been on campus are used by the COVID-19 Response Team to
quickly activate disinfection and closure procedures. To effectively identify people who may have
been in contact with the SARS-CoV-2 positive person, both a manual tracing (interview) and
digital tracing solution is strongly recommended. The University of Denver will engage an appbased digital contact tracing solution, which will allow tracking of contacts using Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE) technology, badging, and WiFi technology. Top considerations in this decision are
our community’s security and privacy. The final decision regarding a contact tracing vendor and
details on the solution and its security will be shared by July 31st .

Manual Tracing
Manual Contact tracing has been conducted at DU since the first positive case on March 13,
2020. Because there were fewer than 20 positive cases on campus since March, manual
tracing has been sufficient to address campus needs. Our first priority when an individual in
our community falls ill is to support them in seeking medical attention and communicate our
concern for their well-being. We also review with them the need to self-isolate and remain
off-campus (or, for campus residents, to isolate them on campus). In each instance,
interviews and follow-up conversations determine when and where the person who had tested
positive or was presumed positive for SARS-CoV-2 had been on campus, with whom they
might have come into contact, and whether that contact included physical proximity of within
six feet for at least 10 minutes and whether the parties were wearing face coverings.
Individuals who may have been in contact with the person are then called to discuss the
possible contact and to provide them with information regarding the need to self-isolate and
stay off campus. This high-touch manual tracing effort has occurred successfully at DU for
our small number of cases, via designated University staff. As we increase the number of
people with access to campus, additional manual contract tracers will be hired and trained,
following guidance of our health partner and under the supervision of our deputized reporter
for the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment, Chris Short. As needed for each
case, additional individualized support will be provided by the Student Affairs and Inclusive
Excellence (SAIE) team, the Health and Counseling Center (HCC), the Vice Provost for
Academic Affairs, and / or Human Resources and Inclusive Community (HRIC), as appropriate.
Digital Tracing
Keeping the DU community safe and limiting spread from any potential cases requires fast
and accurate contact tracing. Best practices for businesses, including university campuses,
involve digital contact tracing. This can involve sensors and wearables, be app-based, or work
from other existing technologies (scheduling software, Wi-Fi, badging). The DU campus has
more than 90 buildings, 125 acres, and 17,000 people at full capacity. To effectively reduce
the chance of an outbreak, we will engage a digital tracing vendor. Users will be asked to
install an application on their mobile device. This tracking, alongside Wi-Fi and badge access
will be used to quickly identify who a person has been in contact with should they test positive
or be presumed positive for the virus causing COVID-19. We recognize the strong concerns
of our community regarding data security and privacy and have intentionally focused on
choosing a vendor that prioritizes these concerns. Data is stored securely and only
temporarily, and location information is only accessed when someone is confirmed or
expected positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Individuals have control over whether
the app runs in the background or foreground, have a user interface, and can disable the
tracking, though this is not recommended. (For more information on privacy and information
security, please see H. Privacy & Data Security.)

Pre-arrival quarantine
For 14 days before their arrival date, all students and visiting family members (for move-in
only), faculty and staff are required to quarantine. During this time, you should remain home
and avoid physical contact with others except those you live with.
The behavior of those already on campus is expected to align with what we are strongly
recommending for our students – following all social distancing and facial covering protocols,
washing hands frequently, and not engaging in large group activities or settings.
If you are unable to quarantine before returning to campus because it is not feasible due to
other responsibilities, and in particular our students who may be working or in training during
the weeks just prior to the return to campus. In such instances, we encourage minimal contact
as much as possible. Avoid large gatherings and social events, maintain a six-foot distance
between yourself and others, use a face covering, refrain from touching your face, and
practice vigilant hand washing. These practices are essential during the duration of the
pandemic, but they should be attended to particularly rigorously the 14 days before a return
to campus.
If you are arriving from abroad, regardless of your nationality, you are required to quarantine
for 14 days upon arrival in the U.S.

Symptom Monitoring
During the 14 days before arrival, students will be required to answer questions regarding
potential COVID-19 symptoms, exposure to the virus, and adherence to quarantine protocols
each day. The symptom monitoring protocol will increase to twice daily once students have
returned to campus and will continue for as long as they remain on campus.
To accomplish this monitoring, everyone in the DU community is expected to download a
smartphone app (on a phone, computer, or tablet) that will support daily symptom monitoring
and allow us to quickly contact-trace should someone in our community test positive for
COVID-19.
Pre-arrival Testing
Prior to arrival on campus, all students must take an RT-PCR test for the virus that causes
COVID-19. We know that many of our law school students and faculty are returning to
campus on August 17th, and to the Auraria Student Lofts beginning August 12th. We will
work closely with you to enable a safe and timely return.
If you will be in Denver | You may provide a validated negative molecular test result
for the virus that causes COVID-19 from a location of your choosing collected during
your 14-day quarantine window. If you prefer, you will be assigned a testing date and
time via DU and our health partner, NJH, to take the test in Denver, administered by
a trained medical professional. Your preference will be asked in the pioneerweb link
13
referenced above for arrival date. More information about how to submit your test
results or to request a testing assignment in Denver will be forthcoming shortly.
If you will be outside Denver | If you will be outside of the Denver metro area during
the 14-days before your fall arrival date, we encourage you to complete a test at a
testing location in your area and provide the verified results to us. Here is a link of
locations where testing is available here.
Testing on campus is free to students, faculty and staff. For those outside Denver, we will
make emergency funds available to students for whom testing costs would pose an undue
hardship.
If you test positive, we strongly encourage you to immediately contact a healthcare provider
and require you to delay your arrival on campus until:
o Ten days have passed since your first symptoms; and
o You are fever-free for 24 hours (without medication); and
o Symptoms have improved; or if asymptomatic, 10 days have passed since
your positive test result and you have not developed symptoms consistent
with a COVID infection
If you test negative, you may return to campus on your selected return date as planned,
having followed all quarantine protocols listed above. Proof of a negative test and adherence
to symptom and quarantine monitoring will be required in order to bypass the testing and
quarantine protocols upon return to campus.
If you have been exposed to someone known or presumed to have COVID-19, this will trigger
the same requirements as a positive test, including delaying your travel and return to campus
for 14 days.
Travel Requirements
Travel requirements: During your travel to campus, everyone is expected to take careful
precautions, including wearing a face covering at all times, practicing excellent hand hygiene,
avoiding face touching and, wherever possible, maintaining a six-foot distance from others.
All community members are expected to follow our existing travel restrictions— specifically
the restrictions against international travel or to any location considered a “hotspot” Hyperlink
for the duration of the fall term. If you must travel to these locations, you will need to remain
off campus and follow the quarantine guidelines outlined above for 14 days.
Once You are on Campus
If you follow the university protocols, test negative and are free of symptoms you can expect
to be in your classes as anticipated and enjoy your face-to-face experiences observing all
social distancing and facial covering protocols, as well as other stated precautions.
If you were not able to meet all the pre-arrival requirements including testing, you will be
required to take an RT-PCR test on your first day on campus. DU will administer these tests 
14
in coordination with NJH. Until test results are received, students will be required to quarantine
either in their dorm room if in a single, or in an off-campus house or apartment if they have
their own bedroom. To be connected to area hotels with discounted University rates, please
contact COVIDcoordinator@du.edu.
Regular testing and contact tracing: We will re-test high-risk individuals (athletes, those
living in multi-person rooms in on- or off-campus housing, etc.) within seven days after their
arrival on campus. This will be paid for by DU.
Additionally, we will conduct random surveillance testing of students, faculty and staff each
week, again, at no charge to individuals. This ongoing testing across the term is an
important step to monitor and protect our community.
Prevention
Personal Hygiene
Practicing personal hygiene and wearing face coverings in combination with maintaining
proper physical distance from others is critical to preventing the spread of the virus on
campus. Community responsibility includes reminding peers and colleagues to practice
personal hygiene and wear personal protective equipment.
Hygiene measures
• Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially
after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or
sneezing.
• If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that
contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub
them together until they feel dry.
• Cough or sneeze into a tissue and dispose of used tissues immediately into a
trash can. If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into the crook of your
elbow, not your hands.
• Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
• Do not shake hands and avoid physical contact with others.
• Eat away from others. Wipe down the eating space before and after the meal.
• Supervisors should encourage breaks for employees to wash hands or use
hand sanitizer.
• Post signage to encourage good hygiene.

Personal Protective Equipment
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is an important component of virus containment.
Below are current PPE requirements.
Face Coverings
All University employees, students, and visitors are required to wear a face
covering at all times while on campus (inside buildings and outside) to help
prevent the spread of disease, except as provided below. Acceptable face
coverings include those provided by DU, where available, and an individual’s
face covering of choice, so long as it meets the applicable CDC and CO State
recommendations. Individuals should maintain six-feet separation
even when they are wearing face coverings. Face coverings should:
• Cover the nose and mouth at all times
• Fit snugly but comfortably against the face
• Include multiple layers of fabric
• Allow for breathing without restriction
• Be disposable or be washable and machine dryable without being damaged
or changing shape
• Be looped around the ears or tied behind the head and neck
• Remain in place until taken off safely
• Be replaced with one that does not need to be frequently adjusted if the
initial face covering moves during work
• Be replaced when they become dirty, wet, and/or difficult to breathe
through
• Neck gaiters are currently not recommended
Exceptions:
• Individuals alone in single offices (with the door closed) are not required
to wear face coverings.
• Individuals may take off their face coverings to eat and drink as long as
they remain 6 feet away from others.
• An individual is not required to wear a face covering if it would inhibit the
individual’s health, provided that employees who cannot wear face
coverings for this reason provide DU with documentation. In these 
16
instances, DU will make every effort to assign such employees to duties
that do not put them in close proximity with other employees or the public.
Other Protective Equipment
DU will provide gloves and other protective equipment as appropriate for an
individual employee’s job duties. It is the department’s responsibility to
provide gloves and PPE for task specific jobs as required by OSHA, CDC, or
DDPHE.
N95 masks are to be worn by University staff in response to a positive case.
The use of the N95 mask requires a fit test through Environmental Health &
Safety (EHS) and medical clearance to wear.
