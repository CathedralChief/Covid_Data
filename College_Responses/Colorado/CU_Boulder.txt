Oct. 7, 2020

Dear students, faculty and staff,

I am writing today with some encouraging news.

As you know, CU Boulder shifted to temporary remote course instruction, effective Wednesday, Sept. 23. The following day, Boulder County Public Health issued a public health order to prohibit gatherings for individuals aged 18 to 22 years old in Boulder, and placed the residents of specific off-campus properties under a mandatory stay-at-home order for 14 days.

During this time, our students have done an amazing job. We have seen a significant decrease in our number of positive cases through our on-campus diagnostic and monitoring tests, and a significant decrease in positive cases in Boulder County. Violations in the residence halls are down, and we are not aware of any summons from this past weekend for students hosting large gatherings on University Hill. I encourage our students—and everyone in our community—to keep up the good work and to keep these trends moving in the right direction.

With sincere gratitude for the outstanding work of our student body, we will transition from our temporary remote teaching mode and resume in-person/hybrid teaching on Wednesday, Oct. 14. We expect most classes to fully return to their original fall 2020 instructional modes by this date, with exceptions based on specific public health requirements and individual faculty requests, subject to department chair and dean approvals.

Students can begin checking with their instructors this week for specific guidance on when and how to transition back to in-person learning experiences (for courses that originally were in person, or included in-person components). Faculty and students should communicate with each other about expectations and preparations for returning to in-person learning. Faculty should consult with their department chairs and/or deans to resolve logistical challenges associated with the transition back to on-campus teaching activities.

Additionally, thanks to your actions, Boulder County Public Health has announced a new public health order today that initiates a “step-down” approach for gatherings of 18- to 22-year-olds in Boulder. There will be four status levels, depending on county COVID-19 metrics, ranging from no gatherings at all to gatherings of six individuals. Students aged 18 to 22 years old should continue to abide by all current COVID-19 orders limiting gatherings to no more than two people through at least Tuesday, Oct. 13. At that point, Boulder County Public Health will make a determination on adjusting those restrictions, and if the CU community continues to keep the numbers of COVID-19 cases down, students will begin to see greater opportunities for in-person social interactions. We know this has been a difficult period, but we’re making progress and need our students to continue engaging in the right behaviors to keep infections down.

Our students’ ability to have in-person social interactions also depends upon their continued participation in COVID-19 testing and contact tracing. All students who temporarily returned home during the past two weeks are strongly encouraged to get tested prior to returning or complete a monitoring test when they return. On-campus students will continue weekly COVID-19 monitoring testing under the protocols that have existed through the course of the semester.

We also need to demonstrate to Boulder County Public Health that we are providing testing for our off-campus students. We have expanded testing to accommodate 3,000 off-campus students, faculty and staff for testing each week. Up to 450 people can be tested each day at the University Memorial Center and 150 people can be tested each day at the Sustainability, Energy & Environment Community building on campus. I encourage our off-campus students, faculty and staff to get tested and help us detect COVID-19 cases early.

We also need students to participate in contact tracing. Not only is this required by the public health order, it is one of the best methods we have of protecting the campus and the community. Students will not be penalized in any way for engaging in contact tracing.

As for the 38 residential properties affected by the county’s stay-at-home order, they can emerge from previous health restrictions by instituting certain measures. More information is available here.

The decision to move back to our hybrid instructional model was made together with Boulder County Public Health based on a variety of factors, including our expanded testing and our progress in bending the curve. I am grateful for the actions you are taking to keep your neighbors healthy and for your resilience and support for each other. You have done a great job in containing the outbreak. If you keep following the guidelines, we can build on this momentum heading into the second half of the semester and beyond.

Please continue to take care of yourselves, and thank you for everything you are doing for the health and safety of our community. For questions and the latest guidance, you can visit our COVID-19 website.

With gratitude,
Phil

Reasons for Returning to In-Person Instruction
The number of COVID-19 cases among students has dropped significantly from the surge in September. With the support of Boulder County Public Health, the campus is able to return to our original hybrid model of instruction that was in place at the start of the fall 2020 semester.

Our ability to return is thanks to the significant efforts of our students over the past few weeks to comply with public health orders, wear masks, physically distance and avoid public gatherings. 

Boulder County Public Health Orders:
Boulder County Public Health on Wednesday announced a pair of new public health orders aimed at continuing to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, particularly among those ages 18 to 22 years within the city of Boulder. 

The new orders, 2020-08 and 2020-09, replace Boulder County Public Health Order 2020-07, which expires at noon on Thursday, Oct. 8. 

The new orders keep current restrictions in place that prohibit gatherings of more than two people within the city among those ages 18 to 22 years. However, they provide new opportunities for loosened restrictions and greater opportunities for in-person social interactions as COVID-19 metrics continue to improve among this age group. 

Boulder County Public Health will assess the status on Tuesday, Oct. 13, and weekly thereafter to make a determination of where we stand and what that means for adjusting the restrictions. 

Our students’ ability to have greater in-person social interactions also depends on their continued participation in COVID-19 testing.

On-campus residents will continue weekly testing under our monitoring program. 

Our on-campus monitoring program is also now open to all off-campus students, as well as all faculty and staff. 

All students who left campus during the remote instruction period are strongly encouraged to get tested prior to returning, as noted in the travel guidance section below.

Students must also participate in contact tracing when contacted. This is a requirement of the public health orders, and is one of the best methods for protecting the campus and community from further spread of COVID-19. Students will not be penalized for participating in contact tracing in any way. 

Full details on the new orders are posted on the Boulder County Public Health webpage.

Academics
We will transition from our current remote teaching mode of operation and resume in-person and hybrid in-person teaching on Wednesday, Oct. 14.

We expect most classes to fully return to their original fall 2020 instructional modes by this date, with exceptions based on specific public health requirements and individual faculty requests, subject to department chair and dean approvals.

Students should check with their instructors for specific guidance on when and how they will transition back to on-campus learning experiences.

Faculty and students should communicate with each other about expectations and preparations for returning to in-person learning.

Faculty should consult with their chairs and/or deans to resolve logistical challenges associated with the transition back to on-campus teaching activities. 

Some faculty/departments/colleges/schools have asked to return to on-campus in-person teaching before Oct. 14.

Faculty should work with their departments/deans to ensure that any early return to in-person instruction is conducted in an orderly, effective and equitable manner, keeping in mind the needs and challenges of our students.

Students should consult with their professor or instructor with any questions on their course modality.

For students (other than those who are in isolation or quarantine) in the residence halls during this remote learning period:

As of Thursday, Oct. 8, gatherings of more than two people among 18-to-22-year-olds continue to be prohibited in the city of Boulder. This restriction is subject to loosen or tighten in accordance with Boulder County Public Health Order 2020-08.

Wear a face covering when you leave your room or apartment, do not have visitors or guests in your hall or room, and complete your weekly saliva monitoring appointment.  

For students (other than those who are in isolation or quarantine) who want to move out of the residence halls for the rest of the semester/academic year:

If a first-year student currently living on campus wants to be released from their housing contract, the student may petition for an exemption to the live-on requirement by submitting the Freshman Release Form in the MyCULiving portal.

Students should refer to their housing contract for further information on the process of early termination.

Residential students who are currently in isolation or in quarantine through the public health office must comply with the directives they have been given and may not travel without permission from Boulder County Public Health or the CU Boulder Public Health office.

Public Health Guidance for Traveling Home
All students are strongly encouraged to remain in Boulder in their local residences during the fall academic term to prevent the unintended spread of the virus to other communities.

Students should think through the risks of traveling home and ensure that the people they’ll be living with agree to allow them to stay. 

Students who are in isolation or quarantine are not allowed to leave without permission in accordance with public health guidance.

Those who wish to do so must have prior approval by Boulder County Public Health or the CU Boulder Public Health office. The CU Boulder Public Health office phone number is 303-735-0017.

CU Boulder strongly encourages other students who wish to move home to get tested for COVID-19 and have a negative result before moving in order to help prevent spread of the virus to other communities. Students should complete the test two to three days before departure. There are multiple ways to get tested for free if you are asymptomatic.

All asymptomatic students can get tested at one of our on-campus monitoring sites to see if there is a need for a diagnostic test.

Both on- and off-campus asymptomatic students can visit the free testing site in East Boulder that is open to the public through at least Oct. 18. 

Students who are symptomatic should contact the Public Health Clinic at Wardenburg.

Students who want to return to campus after being at home must contact their health care provider for testing if they are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. 

For students who are not experiencing symptoms and are able to do so, we encourage them to get tested and receive a negative test result 24 to 48 hours prior to returning to campus. 

Otherwise, asymptomatic students are encouraged to visit one of our on-campus monitoring sites as soon as returning to campus.  

In conjunction with CU Boulder, state and local public health officials, additional health guidance for students who want to return home temporarily or permanently during this time includes:

Public or shared transportation, including air travel, is not allowed for students in isolation, quarantine or who have been identified through contact tracing as a close contact of a COVID-19-positive individual.

Students who live at specific addresses identified in Boulder County Public Health orders as stay-at-home addresses face additional restrictions on returning home that are outlined in the orders and must contact the CU Boulder Public Health office before leaving: 303-735-0017 or contacttracing@colorado.edu.  

If you are traveling: 

Wear a face mask and ride in the rear seat of the vehicle (if in a taxi or rideshare).

Where possible, keep a window open for the duration of the journey.

Handle your own luggage and wipe down your personal items after reaching your destination.

Use cashless payment options, if possible.

If using rideshare or other delivery service options for food or groceries, opt for contactless drop-off.

Isolation Spaces for Students Living on Campus
In order to meet community needs, we have expanded the number of isolation spaces that are available for on-campus residents to reduce community spread and care for our students. 

Isolation spaces are evaluated and considered by public health experts, and each space must have proper ventilation and a private bathroom or bathroom separate from those in use by residents who are not COVID-19-positive. 

In order to protect the privacy of students in isolation, residents will not be notified that isolation spaces are in use in their building.

We have worked to create dedicated isolation buildings. In limited cases, we may need to isolate students with COVID-19 in buildings where healthy students also live. Our students' health and well-being are paramount. In these instances, we will work with our health and facilities experts to take all possible precautions, including providing private or dedicated restrooms for students in isolation and ensuring proper ventilation for all spaces. 

Students who are in isolation spaces receive daily check-ins from Health and Wellness Services to monitor their physical health symptoms, as well as to provide support, including but not limited to food, supplies and mental health resources.

Living Off Campus
Off-campus students must comply with local and state public health orders. Wear a face covering when you leave your home room or apartment and do not have visitors or guests in your apartment or house.

As of Thursday, Oct. 8, gatherings of more than two people among 18-to-22-year-olds continue to be prohibited in the city of Boulder. This restriction is subject to loosen or tighten in accordance with Boulder County Public Health Order 2020-08.

Off-campus students who are not subject to stay-at-home requirements may visit campus in line with the return to in-person learning requirements and as long as they are not gathering outside of the classroom. The limitation on gatherings does not apply to work activities.

Off-campus students who are asymptomatic can take advantage of our on-campus monitoring testing sites.

Where to Study
Students who are not subject to stay-at-home requirements may study anywhere on or off campus, as long as they are alone and appropriately physically distanced from others.   

Students who are not subject to stay-at-home requirements may continue to reserve study space on campus if needed to access remote instruction or coursework (for example, in cases where a student needs a stable internet connection), or to study in between approved in-person lab, studio, or performance courses.

Tuition & Fees
Tuition

Students who choose to take a leave of absence or withdraw from classes for the semester can work with the Office of the Registrar on the process for withdrawing or taking a leave of absence. Students receiving financial aid through CU Boulder should review the Office of Financial Aid's withdrawal policy and contact Financial Aid for individual questions.

Fees

There will not be fee reductions or refunds due to the temporary remote course instruction period that expires Oct. 14. Students will continue to benefit from services and support resources funded through fees. If the campus were to go fully remote for the remainder of the semester, students would receive a graduated refund for certain fees based on the timing of that decision. 

Students who go fully remote for specific health-related reasons and still have in-person courses should contact the Bursar’s Office directly.

Campus housing and dining: Students should refer to their housing contract for information on the process and financial implications associated with early termination. 

Medical Care & COVID-19 Testing
On-campus monitoring testing will continue for all on-campus residents, and is also now available to all off-campus students, faculty and staff who are asymptomatic. On-campus residents: please continue to complete your weekly test. If you have a clinical confirmed positive PCR test for COVID-19, you should not attend the weekly monitoring program while you are in isolation or for the remainder of the semester.

Students who live off-campus can utilize one of two walk-up sites for monitoring tests. These tests are for individuals who are asymptomatic and have no known exposure to COVID-19. 

Testing for students who are symptomatic, have been identified as close contacts through contact tracing, or who have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19 is available at the Public Health Clinic at Wardenburg Health Center. 

Faculty and staff who have been identified as close contacts through contact tracing will have access to testing at the Public Health Clinic at Wardenburg Health Center. Faculty and staff who are asymptomatic and have had no known exposure to COVID-19 can also use the on-campus walkup monitoring sites or the free drive-up testing site in east Boulder.

Free testing is available in the City of Boulder through at least Oct. 18.

Learn more about symptoms and testing.

Students experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should contact their medical provider or the Public Health Clinic at Wardenburg Health Center. For nights and weekends, Medical Services offers a 24/7 nurse line at 303-492-5101 that can recommend self-care options and assess whether someone needs to be seen by a health care provider.

Faculty and staff who are symptomatic should contact their medical provider.

All three sports will begin practice on Friday, Oct. 9. The Buffs' other 14 varsity sports will resume practice upon approval from Boulder County Public Health.

Enforcement
Serious public health violations like hosting or attending a large gathering or breaking isolation will result in an interim 10-day suspension pending adjudication through Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution, with the presumptive result being suspension for the remainder of the semester.

Under Boulder County Public Health Orders 2020-08 and 2020-09, violators may face criminal charges and other penalties.
