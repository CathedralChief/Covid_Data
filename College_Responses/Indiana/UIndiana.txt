How IU is using contact tracing to address COVID-19

Contact tracing helps isolate cases and identifies close contacts of individuals who have tested positive for a disease in order to stop the chain of transmission. For COVID-19, close contacts are defined as someone who has been within 6 feet of an infected person for more than 15 minutes. Read more about contact tracing at IU.

State of Indiana mask mandate, local ordinances

Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb has issued several executive orders over the last few months, including a statewide mask mandate in public areas. Counties in Indiana are required to follow executive orders but are also permitted by law to enact any further orders deemed necessary to protect citizens. Three counties that have IU campuses have taken further measures.

Take a look at those counties and some of those measures.

Student pre-arrival testing

Learn more about how to be screened and tested for COVID-19 as an IU student or employee in the Frequently Asked Questions section of the site.

What you need to know
Respond to mitigation testing: Help IU identify positive cases and protect the community. Check your email regularly to see if you’ve been selected to participate in mitigation testing. If selected, schedule your test that week and get your results in two to five days.

Focus on your mental health: We know this is a difficult time right now. If you’re feeling anxious, depressed, or stressed out, please know that you’re not alone. IU has resources that can help, including counseling services.

Continue practicing the basics: Best practices haven’t changed. We can all help slow the spread of coronavirus by limiting travel, physically distancing from others, and wearing masks in public.

Good Hygiene and Illness Prevention
Remind employees, students, and visitors that
they can reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19
by taking the same steps to prevent infection
from the flu and the common cold:
• Maintain physical distance of at least 6 feet
from others.
• Wear a mask as appropriate. (See IU’s
guidance on wearing face coverings.)
• Wash hands often with soap and water for
at least 20 seconds. If water is not available,
use hand sanitizer with at least 60%
alcohol.
• Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth
with unwashed hands.
• Avoid contact with people who are sick.
• Stay home while sick and avoid close
contact with others.
• Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow
or a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and
immediately dispose of the used tissue.
• Utilize secondary handwashing or sanitizing
stations that are set up with either hand
sanitizer or wipes/towelettes.
• Avoid hand-shaking to reduce the spread of
germs

Community Responsibility
Acknowledgement
Prior to returning to work, employees must
acknowledge:
• The serious nature of COVID-19
• The importance of each individual’s
knowledge of the risks presented by the
virus
• The need to monitor their own health
• The need to notify appropriate personnel
if they are symptomatic and/or exposed
and be tested if necessary
The Community Responsibility Acknowledgement can be found on One.IU. A paper version
is also available, via your unit HR representative, for employees to complete.

germs.
Employees, students, and visitors must be
able to wash their hands after touching any
surface/tool suspected of being contaminated,
before and after eating or using the restroom,
and before touching their face.

Cleaning, Disinfection, and
Hygiene Procedures
Even under normal business conditions,
common touchpoints should be cleaned on a
recurring schedule based upon frequency of
use, occupancy, and overall risk. Cleaning and
sanitization or disinfection procedures will be
increased in frequency and be consistent with
the level of risk mitigation deemed feasible and
appropriate by facilities and environmental,
health, and safety professionals. 

Advanced COVID-19 Cleaning Protocol
An advanced COVID-19 cleaning protocol has
been developed and provided to appropriate
maintenance groups outlining the steps to be
taken when known positive cases exist and it’s
not possible to temporarily close a space for
72 hours (see Interim Disinfection Guidance
for Spaces Occupied by a PUI or Individual
Confirmed to Have COVID-19).
When advanced cleaning or temporary closure
occurs, IUEHS provides notification to the
dean, or other designated staff, of the affected
school and/or facility. Facilities groups also
provide approved signage to be displayed in
the affected area(s).
Additional Hygiene Considerations
• Employees should proactively disinfect
personal workstations in addition to
shared areas or items (e.g., conference
rooms, equipment, workstations) before
and after use.
• When departments operate in a unique
setting (e.g., clinical, dental, childcare),
cleaning, disinfection, and hygiene
procedures originating from the
appropriate regulatory agency, research
protocol, or more specific IU guidance
should be implemented

The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) has issued an exhaustive
list of approved disinfectants.
Departments should ensure their
cleaning staff use products from this list.
• Departments, where feasible, should
remove high-touch items such as
magazines, common pens, etc.
• Advanced cleaning should only be
performed by designated and trained
university staff in accordance with the
advanced COVID-19 cleaning protocol
(Interim Disinfection Guidance for Spaces
Occupied by PUI or Confirmed COVID-19). 

Receiving Packages and Mail
According to the CDC, handling mail and/
or packages is unlikely the primary means of
spreading/contracting COVID-19. However, it is
still important to follow good hygiene practices
when handling mail.
When receiving a package or mail:
• Limit in-person contact when accepting a
delivery, or stay at least 6 feet away from
the delivery person.
• Wash your hands with soap and water for
at least 20 seconds after touching the
package.
• Use hand sanitizer with at least 60%
alcohol when soap and water are not
available.
• Avoid touching your face, eyes, nose, or
mouth.
Hand sanitizer will be made available inside
building entrances and at other high-traffic
areas as deemed appropriate by applicable
facilities groups, and should contain at least
60% alcohol.

Physical Distancing in the Workplace
Physical/social distancing within workplace
environments is just as important as it is in the
broader community.
Utilizing distance to reduce the risk of
infection is the basic concept behind physical
distancing. This can be accomplished in the
workplace to mitigate the risk of community
spread of COVID-19. Using visual signage
in work areas, as well as informational and
educational signage at entry and exit points, is
recommended for high-traffic areas.
The university is developing signage that can
be used by all units across IU (see section
below regarding approved signage).
Note: Physical distancing as outlined in this
section may be particularly challenging in some
work environments such as athletic or childcare
settings. However, physical distancing in these
circumstances should still be attempted as
much as possible. See additional sections
below for more information

Masks (Face Coverings)
Masks are mandatory in campus buildings
and on campus transportation. They are also
mandatory in outdoor spaces when physical
distancing is difficult.
The use of masks can help prevent the spread
of the virus by decreasing the spread of
respiratory droplets produced during talking,
sneezing, and coughing.
All IU employees and students will be provided
with two washable masks before the fall 2020
semester begins. While masks will be provided,
individuals may also choose to wear their own
(see guidance for examples of acceptable face
coverings).
Maintaining at least 6-foot physical distance
from others remains the primary means of
slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus
that causes COVID-19.
Types of campus spaces where masks are
mandatory include, but are not limited to,
classrooms, office spaces (including cubicles),
elevators, hallways, outdoor spaces, and other
locations where intermittent interactions with
others might occur, such as seating near aisle
ways and other passages.
Masks are not required within enclosed spaces
when one person is present with the door
closed. Employees may eat/drink at their
workspaces in an open or cubicle environment
as long as physical distancing can be
maintained (see policy UA-21 for more details).
Students are prohibited from eating and/or
drinking in classrooms and labs (see policy
STU-02 for more details).
Additional detailed guidance and requirements
for masks can be found within the Interim
Guidance on Masks (Face Coverings).
(Note: More restrictive Indiana University
guidance regarding respiratory protection in
specific settings supersedes this document.)

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
for Employees
Employees may be required to wear other
personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves,
gowns, etc.) or respiratory protection due to
the nature of their work.
Research will order PPE through the form
created by the Office of the Vice President for
Research.
All other departments should order PPE
through Purchasing. Details are available at
purchase.sitehost.iu.edu/covid/covid.php.
Due to the shortage of PPE, such as N95
filtering face-piece respirators (FFRs)
and barrier devices (surgical/isolation
masks), Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) is permitting the
reuse of these devices when the shortage is
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. IUEHS has
developed guidance for the reuse of N95 FFRs
and barrier devices (Interim Guidance for the
Reuse of N95 FFRs and Barrier Devices).
All users of these devices should become
familiar with this guidance. It permits the
reuse of these devices up to 10 times when
the devices are in good, uncontaminated
condition and availability of the devices is low.
The user must wait 5 days between the use
and reuse of a device. Proper storage of these
devices is required.
The Indiana University Respiratory Protection
Program addresses respiratory protection
requirements of employees; however,
this program does not apply to surgical,
isolation, and cloth face masks (which are not
considered respirators).
Other PPE considerations for department
planning includes:
• When departments operate in a unique
setting (clinical, research, dental,
childcare, etc.), PPE guidance originating
from the appropriate regulatory agency,
research protocol, or more specific IU
guidance for that setting should be
followed.
• In hazardous chemical or biological
laboratories, cloth face coverings should
be removed and replaced with disposable
surgical masks when entering the
laboratory area (see Interim Guidance on
Protection of Laboratory Personnel during
the COVID-19 Pandemic for more detailed
guidance).
• Cloth or homemade masks/face
coverings should not be used in lieu of
respiratory protection (i.e., respirators)
where it is required.
• Consider relocating employees to
personal work spaces, alternating
schedules, etc., in order to reduce the
need for wearing face coverings.
• Implement mask and respirator reuse
protocols where safe and feasible.
• Establish a consistent and adequate
supply of the necessary PPE.
See “Appendices” for guidance developed by
IU for a wide range of activities. 
Building Ventilation
IU is committed to minimizing COVID-19 risk
for building users by regularly inspecting air
handling units, replacing filters, and ensuring
air handlers are functioning as designed. IU will
also continue to monitor and react to federal,
state, public health, and industry standard
heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)
guidelines to manage and mitigate risk where
possible.
Due to the variety of different building types,
ventilation systems, and facility controls
being utilized, no single set of guidelines can
accommodate every individual building type
or system across all IU facilities. In many cases,
altering HVAC parameters (e.g., air flow, filter
type, etc.) of existing ventilation systems
beyond designed capabilities can have
detrimental effects on the overall health and
comfort of a building. Therefore, from a public
and environmental health perspective, ventilation
alterations should not be viewed as a substitute
for physical distancing and masks in the overall
University environment.
Some additional considerations for ventilation are:
• Unless there are specific design needs for a
facility (e.g., operatories), avoid overwhelming
engineering and facilities teams with
requests for individual air flow and HVAC
design information.
• Building occupants should continue to
contact facilities groups when it is too hot,
too cold, or there appears to be some type
of dysfunction with an existing system.
• Propping open exterior doors or windows is
generally not recommended as it will cause
the system to work less efficiently and can
create excessive humidity in buildings (and
related air quality concerns).
• Interior doors should not be propped open
when that practice overrides mechanical
interconnections, affects security, fire
or life safety codes (e.g., to prevent the
spread of fire), or chemical or biological
containment practices (e.g., laboratories). 
Avoid the use of portable high velocity
fans, especially in common areas or open
offices when blowing across multiple
workstations.
This guidance is also available online as Interim
Guidance on Ventilation Systems in IU Buildings.
Screening, Testing, Isolation, and
Quarantine
A robust testing program is vital for
maintaining the health and safety of the IU
community during the ongoing pandemic.
There are a variety of testing measures and
plans in place that will continue through
the fall semester, including pre-arrival, onarrival, and mitigation testing. Find more
information about COVID-19 testing at IU on
the Fall 2020 website.
The following are guiding principles for
illnesses and screening for campuses:
• Students and employees should stay
home if sick or if a household member is
diagnosed with COVID-19.
• All students and employees must be
prepared to isolate or quarantine when
necessary.
• Everyone must be prepared to participate
in any case investigation and contact
tracing with state, local, or university
health officials.
• All students and employees must
self-monitor health for symptoms of

COVID-19 and use IU Health’s virtual
screening protocol when symptomatic.
Some groups, such as those who work
in areas such as food services, childcare,
public transportation, athletics, etc.,
may undergo a health screening and
temperature check regularly before work
or work-related activities (temperature
checks are not administered by IU
Health).
• If you test positive for COVID-19, contract
tracers will work with you as part of the
case investigation to identify your close
contacts. They will notify your close
contacts of their exposure (while keeping
your identity anonymous) and instruct
them to self-quarantine. Additionally,
if there are close contacts that you are
comfortable notifying at the time you
receive your result, such as housemates,
family members, or friends, you can let
them know immediately in order to help
stop the potential spread of COVID-19.
• Note: A “close contact” is generally
defined as someone who is within 6 feet
of a person who is sick with COVID-19 for
15 minutes or more:
◦ in the two days prior to symptom
onset (or from the time of a positive
test for asymptomatic cases), and
◦ through someone’s infectious period
(which is generally 10 days), or as
otherwise identified by the contact
tracing case investigator.)

If you are identified as a close contact by a
university health official, or after you report your
own exposure as a close contact using IU’s selfreport form, you’ll receive detailed instructions
on quarantine and next steps, which includes
enrolling you in the Twistle symptom-monitoring
service. Through Twistle, you’ll receive daily
check-ins from an IU Health provider to ask
about your symptoms and report any concerns
or worsening symptoms. IU Health will also
use Twistle to release you from quarantine or
isolation via a text message notification.
If you develop symptoms during quarantine,
use the IU Health screening tool to access
testing and isolate yourself while you await
results. If a test shows you are positive for
COVID-19, follow the guidance above for
isolation when symptomatic.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is 2-14 days
from the time of someone’s exposure. Therefore,
IU community members who are identified as a
close contact of a confirmed case of COVID-19
must quarantine for 14 days from their last known
exposure to see if they become sick, and should
monitor their health daily.
Exposed as a
close contact
Quarantine for
14 days from last
known exposure
Return to
campus
A close contact in a community or campus
setting is determined by contact tracers during
case investigation. For COVID-19, a close contact
is generally defined as someone who was within
six feet of a positive case of COVID-19 for at
least 15 minutes, regardless of the use of masks,
either within the two days prior to the case’s
symptom onset, or in the two days prior to the
case receiving an asymptomatic positive result.
Other situations where someone is defined
as a close contact may include living with or
providing care with someone who is sick with
COVID-19.
Note: The definition of a close contact excludes
those who have had COVID-19 in the past three
months. People who have tested positive for
COVID-19 do not need to quarantine or get
tested again for up to 3 months as long as they
do not develop symptoms again. People who
develop symptoms again within 3 months of
their first bout of COVID-19 may need to be
tested again if there is no other cause identified
for their symptoms.
Common Areas
Common areas provide a challenge for
physical distancing protocols. Common space
protocols include:
• Employees should wear a mask.
• Employees should consider bringing
their own meals if possible and eating at
their desk to limit congregations in break
rooms.
• Any place where a line forms, physical
distancing should be maintained. In
places where this is particularly hard to
achieve, provide visible markings with
tape to illustrate safe distances.
• Display signage that reminds people
to maintain safe physical distancing in
common areas (see signage section for
approved examples).
• Where applicable, encourage the use of
stairs instead of elevators.
Supply for offices:
• Common areas such as main department
offices should have hand sanitizer,
sanitation wipes, and signage on how
to prevent the spread of disease (see
section on hygiene).
• Employees should have access to an
appropriate number of sanitation wipes
for desks in the office. Sanitation wipes
can be requested from facilities through
an online form.
• If proper physical distancing cannot be
maintained, the use of conference rooms
should be restricted. If conference rooms
must be used, sanitation wipes should be
provided in the room.
Departments operating in leased and/or
multitenant facilities will need to work with
building management to ensure
implementation of the above protocols.
Elevators
Hand sanitizer stations will be provided at the
exits of each high-traffic elevator as determined
by facilities. It is encouraged that individuals
use the stairs when possible, and less than two
individuals ride an elevator at a time.
