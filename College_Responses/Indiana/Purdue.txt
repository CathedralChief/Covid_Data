Ambassadors have many roles on campus including tabling for various Protect Purdue initiatives, presenting to student organizations or classrooms, creating social and video content for the student body, working campus events or even educating students in everyday conversations. Protect Purdue Ambassadors are here to help the entire Purdue community have a safe and successful academic year on campus.

Pre-Arrival COVID-19 Testing for Purdue Students
All West Lafayette-bound Purdue students were required to be tested for COVID-19 before moving into residence halls and attending classes in August 2020.

Purdue partnered with Vault Health to offer free at-home COVID-19 test kits to a majority of students prior to their campus arrival. Students who received an email from Purdue with instructions on ordering a test kit can follow the steps below to complete the test and get results in 48-72 hours.

NOTE: If you haven’t received the Purdue email with instructions on ordering a Vault Health at-home testing kit, but will be on-campus for classes this fall, you should plan to pursue an alternate testing option.
All Purdue undergraduate, graduate and professional program students planning to be in West Lafayette for on-campus instruction must test negative before coming to campus, whether they are arriving from another part of the United States or another country. 

All students coming to campus from outside the United States should quarantine upon arrival until they can be tested for COVID-19, whether in connection with Purdue’s partnership with Vault Health or an authorized sampling and collection site. Please contact the Protect Purdue Health Center 24/7 by calling 765-496-INFO (4636) or toll-free at 833-571-1043 and pressing “1” to make testing arrangements.

Dear Boilermaker,

Thank you! As your dean of students, I want to share with you how very pleased and proud I am of the role each of you are playing in our collective effort to Protect Purdue. We are now in Week 9 and, all-things-considered, are doing remarkably well as a community. Without your commitment, we would not have made it this far in the semester. Your work and dedication to keep Purdue safe are valued and your continued commitment is definitely needed.

Now more than ever, we, the faculty, staff, students and community-at-large, must continue to do our part to keep our community safe! We know COVID-19 fatigue is real. We are seeing various other countries, states and communities prematurely reduce their focus and efforts to keep themselves and others safe. They are letting their guard down and in turn, relaxing their own personal safety protocols and precautions. Now is NOT the time to relax. Now is NOT the time to stop being cautious. Now is NOT the time to change what has been working for us. If we are going to make it to our predetermined time of mid-November when we plan to go remote, we must stay vigilant and cautious.

Purdue Football returns on Saturday, October 24th against Iowa. As an avid Boilermaker fan myself, it will be difficult knowing that our Boilermakers are on the field without fans in the stands to cheer them on to victory. Having said that, what our Boilermakers need from us most of all now, is for us to continue to stay the course with all things related to the Protect Purdue Pledge and avoid the spread or surge of the COVID-19 virus. Watch the game together, but in small socially distanced groups. Cheer loud and proud, but do so with your mask on to prevent the spread of droplets that are capable of spreading the virus. Enjoy the game and visiting with friends, but as always, do so in smart, responsible, and safe ways.

In this same vein, please see the below guidance, recommendations, and reminders to assist in keeping us on campus through mid-November.

Dear students, 

We are looking forward to welcoming you to campus in a few short weeks! As the beginning of the fall semester approaches, we’re launching a series of communications to keep you informed of the critical steps you must take to return to campus along with other relevant updates. 

If you are returning to campus for in-person classes, these tasks must be completed as soon as possible before you will be permitted to move into residence halls, attend classes and/or participate in campus activities.

Be tested for COVID-19 and have a negative test result on file or, if recently tested positive, have documentation from the Protect Purdue Health Center that you have completed a 10-day isolation after the test (asymptomatic) or 10 days after symptom onset.
Complete the required Student Health & Safety training that’s preloaded into your Brightspace account.
Provide updated contact information, including a primary phone number and the address where you plan to live while attending classes for the Fall 2020 semester.
Login to your myPurdue account and click on the Academic tab.
Look for the “Important Student Contact Information” and update your Student Primary Phone and Student Address while Enrolled. If you are not living in University Residences this semester, it’s imperative that you provide the address of where you plan to live while Fall 2020 classes are in session. This information will be used for contact tracing, which is designed to identify, communicate and contain possible COVID-19 exposure, if needed. 
Thank you for doing your part to Protect Purdue. We look forward to seeing you soon! Boiler up!  

Dear students,

We are looking forward to welcoming you back to campus or to the online option this fall and write today with a very important update on an essential step you need to take if you are returning to campus.

All undergraduate, graduate and professional program students coming to the West Lafayette campus for residential classes must be tested for COVID-19 before moving into residence halls and attending classes when they resume on August 24th.

Students who opted for the fully online option and are not returning to campus do not need to complete a COVID-19 test at this time. Students returning to or coming to campus from outside the United States must quarantine for 14 days and coordinate with the Protect Purdue Health Center to schedule their COVID-19 test.

We have announced an innovative partnership with Rutgers University and Vault Health that will provide you, free of charge, a testing kit that offers a reliable, secure, and convenient, medically-supervised saliva screening for the COVID-19 virus that can be done in your home. Purdue continues to explore additional options for completing testing and will share this information as soon as it becomes available. 

The Vault Health test is the only authorized saliva-based solution of its kind for tests conducted in the United States and is currently used by many national companies, as well as sports leagues such as the National Hockey League, the PGA Tour and Major League Soccer.

How to get tested
Please Note:  If you need to complete a COVID-19 test you will receive an email at the appropriate time.

Purdue students who have elected to take on-campus classes this fall will receive an email when their time to return to campus approaches outlining the steps to register for the testing program with Vault Health. 

After receiving your testing kit in the mail, your telehealth visit may begin, but should be completed no sooner than 14 days before traveling to campus to move into a residence hall, participate in an on-campus activity, or begin classes.

Your test results will be sent directly to you via email, and those results can be expected generally within 48-72 hours after your sample kit arrives back to Vault Health for processing. A copy of your test result also will be sent to the Protect Purdue Health Center. A negative test result must be on file at the Protect Purdue Health Center before you can move into a residence hall or participate in classroom instruction. Once you have completed your COVID-19 test, you should begin to follow rigorously the elements of the Purdue Pledge – to protect yourself, protect others and protect the Purdue community.

Those individuals testing positive will receive guidance from the Protect Purdue Health Center and should not travel to West Lafayette or come to campus for any reason until they isolate for 10 days and are medically cleared by the Protect Purdue Health Center.

Again, you will receive another email soon that describes in detail the testing process. If you have any further COVID-19-related questions at this time, contact the Protect Purdue Health Center  by calling 765-496-INFO (4636) or toll-free at 833-571-1043. An option is available after hours to connect individuals to the Protect Purdue Health Center case manager as well to leave a voicemail.

If you test positive
You must self-isolate at home and not travel to campus for any reason. The Protect Purdue Health Center will help coordinate the self-isolation process.
After you have completed the 10-day self-isolation period in coordination with the Protect Purdue Health Center, the Protect Purdue Health Center will provide you with the documentation necessary to travel to campus and move into a residence hall and/or begin on-campus programming and classes.
If your test result is negative
Please adhere to all elements of the Protect Purdue pledge – always wearing a face mask in public, maintain a 6-foot distance from others, wash hands diligently and begin monitoring daily for symptoms. If you begin experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, especially a fever over 100.4oF, call the Protect Purdue Health Center. Remember: A negative test result only means you do not have COVID-19 at the time of the test, it does not mean you are immune to catching the virus.

Other details to note
A resilient curriculum plan, which combines flexible face-to-face and online instruction, is being developed to ensure students who must be isolated because of COVID-19 don’t fall behind on their studies.

Failure to complete a COVID-19 test and have the results filed with the Protect Purdue Health Center upon arrival will hinder your ability to move into a residence hall and/or begin in-person classes.

Importantly, if you’ve already tested negative for COVID-19 this summer, but your testing date is more than 14 days before attending on-campus activities, then you will need to be tested again.

Testing as the semester progresses will continue to be offered by prescription from the Protect Purdue Health Center for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals on the West Lafayette campus in accordance with the process developed by the Purdue Medical Advisory Team in alignment with guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Indiana State Department of Health.

Additional details can be found https://protect.purdue.edu/students/testing-details/.

Through these preventative and proactive measures, we take another important step to protect the Purdue student body, our faculty, staff, overall campus and members of the local community — particularly the most vulnerable.

Thank you for doing your part. Again, we look forward to beginning the Fall semester with you – either here in West Lafayette or virtually.

Sincerely,

Jay T. Akridge
Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs and Diversity

Dr. Esteban Ramirez
Chief Medical Officer, Protect Purdue Health Center

Protect Purdue Plan
The Protect Purdue Plan is our comprehensive strategy to keep our campus and community safe by limiting the spread of COVID-19. It is driven by science and the latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Indiana State Department of Health and other scientific organizations.

Led by the Protect Purdue Implementation Team, which works in tandem with our external Medical Advisory Team and a talented team of Purdue subject matter experts, and with the oversight of the Purdue Board of Trustees, the plan outlines the policies, procedures, guidelines and tactics needed for the successful resumption of campus activities this fall.

Each part of this plan is aimed at offering the safest experience we can to protect all members of our Purdue community, especially the most vulnerable, to the serious consequences of COVID-19. These are the small steps and major moves we’re all taking to protect ourselves, protect others and protect our Purdue community.

No community as large as Purdue’s campus can guarantee an environment free of COVID-19, and the measures described in this plan recognize that reality. While much has gone into this effort to protect the Purdue community, we trust that all its members — faculty, staff, students and visitors alike — will ultimately take responsibility for their own health and safety and act in a manner that demonstrates respect and consideration for those around them, consistent with the Protect Purdue Pledge.
