BUILDING ACCESS
Students entering many buildings to attend in-person classes may be checked at the building entrance to make sure that they are wearing a required face covering and to verify their Building Access status.

You can show your Building Access in two ways:

Safer Illinois app
COVID-19 Boarding Pass
More information about the Building Access process is available on the Building Access page.

FACE COVERING AND SOCIAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS
To reduce the transmission of COVID-19 infection, all students, employees and visitors must wear a face covering in any university building, facility and classroom unless they are physically isolated in a private space or room.

Face coverings also must be worn in all public places and settings on campus where social distancing of six feet cannot be maintained. This includes outdoor spaces on campus and situations such as traveling to and from classes or events. 

There are more details about face coverings and examples of acceptable face coverings on the Face Coverings Page.

QUARANTINE, ISOLATION & CONTACT TRACING
All students who test positive for COVID-19 are required to isolate for 10 days per guidance by the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District.

We are coordinating and partnering closely with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District to support their work to manage contact tracing for all COVID-19 cases in Champaign County that are related to our faculty, staff or students.

More information about quarantine and isolation can be found on the Quarantine page.

RETURNING TO CAMPUS AFTER QUARANTINE OR ISOLATION
Champaign-Urbana Public Health District provides permission for you to end quarantine or isolation. Learn about what you should do to ease your transition back to full campus participation on the Return to Campus after COVID-19 Quarantine and Isolation page.

CLASSROOMS
The Fall 2020 semester is going to be unlike any other in the university’s history, and one of the areas that will have some of the most noticeable adjustments is in the classroom itself.

Learn more about these classroom protocols on the On-Campus Students page.

Study Spaces
The Office of the Registrar maintains a list of classrooms that are available for use between classes and events for students who may need a location to participate in an online class or to study.

Social distancing and face covering requirements apply. Please wipe your own seat with supplies provided. Furniture may not be moved within the room or to another location. Room schedules can be found outside the classroom. Please be courteous to other users and to incoming classes or events and be prepared to exit at building close.

Visit the Registrar’s Indoor Space Specifications page to find a list of some of the available study spaces on campus.

Remote Students
Long before the disruptions of COVID-19, Illinois was a pioneer in the field of online education. Our faculty and staff have been innovators and leaders in leveraging advances in technology into new ways of teaching and learning for the 21st century. We are committed to ensuring that every student, in every mode of delivery, has the transformational educational experience that we promise here at Illinois.

The Fall 2020 semester will see many students taking some or all of their classes online. Even portions of in-person courses may contain online components. Therefore, all students should familiarize themselves with the remote components and services used in their courses.

The university is providing resources to help foster student academic success online.

Find more information on the Remote Students page.

Chancellor’s Weekly Update
Every week, Chancellor Jones provides university updates, resources and announcement regarding COVID-19.

Past updates are available in the Chancellor’s Weekly Update archive.

FACULTY AND STAFF
College and Unit Information
In preparation for return to on-campus operations, colleges and units were asked to prepare plans to maximize safety on-campus, as well as to help prepare their employees. Each unit also named at least one COVID Coordinator to help facilitate the college or unit’s local efforts. We recommend all faculty and staff familiarize themselves with their unit’s plans.

Links to all of the available College and Unit Plans as well as a list of COVID Coordinators can be found on the College and Unit Information page.

On-Campus COVID-19 Testing 
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has developed a saliva-based test to help the university maximize on-campus safety.

All university faculty and staff participating in any on-campus activities are required to participate in on-campus COVID-19 testing once per week.

If you are an employee who is not planning to come to campus you will not be required to be tested. But any employee returning to campus for any length of time must be tested in accordance with current campus requirements.

More detailed information about the testing program is available on the On-Campus COVID-19 Testing page and available test sites can be found on the On-Campus COVID-19 Testing Locations page.

Training
Faculty and staff should take the Division of Research Safety’s COVID-19 online training by August 24 as part of their individual safety responsibility.

Teaching
The university is allowing each college and department to determine the appropriate modality for each course, depending on the nature of the course, curricular requirements and faculty availability.  Faculty and graduate students who are unable to return to campus for reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic will still have opportunities to teach and engage students remotely.

COURSE SCHEDULES
Student schedules, reflective of the modifications made by departments, are available in Student Self-Service and myIllini.

Courses have different types of delivery mode, which is the way the instructor has chosen for class meetings. Here are some commonly-used terms for these delivery modes:

Asynchronous sections are online with no scheduled meeting time. Each student is responsible for keeping track of readings, assignments, and due dates.
Hybrid courses combine in-person and online, often with an online lecture and an in-person discussion section or lab.
Hyflex is an instruction form using the most available options. Instructors using hyflex modality provide students the option to attend in-person, synchronously “attend” (through Zoom, for example), or asynchronously participate by watching recorded in-person and/or synchronous sessions.
In-person courses meet in an assigned space on campus. To ensure social distancing protocols are met, instructors may use distributed attendance to ensure the maximum number of people in the space does not exceed recommended capacity. With distributed attendance, specified students in the in-person course will attend on certain days, other students on other days. Students should contact the course instructor if they need information on or have questions about distributed attendance procedures.
Synchronous courses “meet” at scheduled times via Zoom or another online platform.
CLASS ATTENDANCE
Each instructor has a class-specific attendance policy. Students should review each course section’s attendance policies, which should be in the course syllabus, and establish open communication with instructors by asking for clarification on any aspect of these policies. If an instructor asks for a verified absence letter from the Office of the Dean of Students, students can submit requests via this website

Undergraduates with questions or concerns should consult with their academic advisors or college office, and graduate students should consult with their advisors or the Graduate College.

Information for Instructors

Remote Instructors
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Whether online or in-person, instructors should honor class start and end times. Student schedules still have many back-to-back class sessions.
It is recommend all exams be offered remotely.  Space for face-to-face instruction time is limited and precious, and we suggest that it not be used for exams.
Instructors must adhere to the final exam schedule.
EXCUSING ABSENCES
In addition to students missing class because they are ill, some students may miss classes because they have been asked to quarantine or isolate. In these situations, in order to protect the privacy rights of students, specific information about a verified absence will not be provided to instructors. Because instructors will not know the exact reason for a verified absence, we strongly recommend that all verified absences be excused.

Since absences might be more frequent and prolonged, consider grading mechanisms that permit flexibility for students.  For example, students might be provided with the opportunity to utilize late due dates for some number of assignments.

ICES SCORES
The University decided to allow instructors to omit without penalty any ICES scores from promotion dossiers for the Spring 2020 semester, recognizing the potentially disruptive impact of switching to remote learning during the semester. Given that instructors have had time to prepare to teach in different modalities for the Fall 2020 semester, the University will require ICES scores for Fall 2020 to be part of promotion dossiers. The University will revisit this decision if there is a sudden switch in the approach to the Fall semester.
