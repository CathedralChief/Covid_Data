Thank you for adapting to these challenges, and for your dedication to safeguarding our University community while continuing to advance our educational mission.

Before Returning To Campus
In order to return to campus, each member of our community is required to attend an online COVID-19 training program and acknowledge via an online attestation form that they will comply with the University’s COVID-19 health requirements.

Training, Acknowledgement and Attestation Regarding COVID-19
Anyone returning to campus (students, faculty, other academic appointees, postdoctoral researchers, and staff) will be required to complete one of the following online training courses in advance:  

Students: Campus and Student Life – COVID-19 General Safety Training (cvd-03W)
Employees and Non-lab Based Researchers:  COVID-19 General Safety Training (cvd-02W)
Lab Based Researchers: COVID-19 Controlled Resumption of Research Activities (cvd-01W) 
The training is accessible via the EHSA safety management system.  In order to access EHSA you must have an active Cnet ID (the prefix of your UChicago email). 

If you are unfamiliar with EHSA, please see the resources listed below for tips and tricks.

Following the COVID-19 training, all individuals returning to campus are required to sign an online attestation form to acknowledge and attest that they will comply with the required safety precautions. The attestation must be completed as an online form, but for reference we have posted the pdf of the attestation for students, and the attestation for all others. Both versions affirm that the signer will comply with safety precautions, including:

Health and Wellness
Testing, Contact Tracing, Quarantine, and Isolation
Accessing University Facilities
Travel and Guests
Ongoing Commitment, Inherent Risk and Non-Compliance
The UChicago Health Pact
When back on campus, we ask that everyone commit to protecting our community by following the UChicago Health Pact – a brief reminder of our commitment to uphold public health requirements.
Wear a face covering in University buildings, and on campus grounds
when others are within 6 feet
• Maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from others whenever possible
• Comply with on-campus and off-campus restrictions on social gatherings,
including parties
• Wash my hands frequently or use hand sanitizer (for example, before eating,
after using the restroom, after touching shared objects or surfaces, and before
each class)
• Check my health symptoms daily, and stay home if I don’t feel well
or am experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms
• Report promptly to C19HealthReport@uchicago.edu if I have knowingly been
exposed to or test positive for COVID-19
• Raise any safety concern with my supervisor or academic leader, or
through UCAIR
• Cooperate with public health workers and adhere to all quarantine requirements
By committing to the UChicago Health Pact, we all help prevent the
spread of COVID-19 and contribute to a shared culture of public health at
the University of Chicago.


Universal Face Coverings
Everyone is expected to wear a face covering over the nose and the mouth at all times while in University buildings, with narrow exceptions. Individuals can remove face coverings if they are in a private room/office alone with the door shut or while eating indoors with at least 8 feet of social distance. Face coverings must also be worn while on campus grounds when others are within 6 feet.

As part of return to campus planning, the University is providing two cloth face masks and a thermometer to each to each faculty member, OAA, postdoctoral researcher, student, and staff member who will be regularly on campus. More details are available in the overview document.

Hand Washing
Everyone is expected to wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after being in a public place, touching surfaces often touched by others, and after nose blowing, coughing, sneezing, or eating. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of the hands and rub them together until they feel dry.

Wash your hands graphic, providing details on how to correctly wash your hands to kill bacteria. 

Social Distancing
Limiting contact among people on campus is critical. Campus work, classroom and study spaces are being reconfigured to provide 6 feet of distance between people, and while on campus, everyone is expected to maintain 6 feet of physical distance from others where possible. When walking in corridors and entries where you must pass someone close than 6 feet away, move with purpose. The University has begun to post signs to facilitate social distancing, including specifying the number of people allowed in a particular area at one time.

Restrictions on Gatherings
To maintain social distancing requirements, all members of our community must follow city and state restrictions on gatherings, including parties. The City of Chicago has prohibited gatherings and parties in private residences with more than 6 people who do not live in the household. Members of our campus community who attend any gathering are expected to wear a face covering and maintain at least 6 feet of social distancing.

Disinfection
Workspaces and frequently touched surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected regularly.

Anyone coming to campus is expected to self-monitor for symptoms and stay home if you have potentially been exposed to COVID-19 or have had any symptoms, including:

Cough
Runny or stuffy nose
Shortness of breath
Headache
Fever
Difficulty breathing
Chills
Body aches
Sore throat
New loss of taste or smell
Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea

COVID-19 Exposure
Individuals who are symptomatic or have tested positive for COVID-19 should not come to campus for at least 10 days since the symptoms first appeared AND 24 hours have passed since resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and other symptoms have improved.

Anyone with symptoms should not go to their University destination and should consult their healthcare provider and inform their supervisor or academic leader. Any faculty, academic appointee, postdoctoral researcher, or staff member who is experiencing symptoms or has been identified as a close contact may call the UChicago Medicine COVID-19 triage hotline for screening, at 773.702.2800.  Students should call UChicago Student Wellness at 773.834.WELL.

According to the protocol, any University community member who has a confirmed case, symptoms, or exposure must promptly self-report via 
COVID-19 Safety Incident Reporting
If you believe that a required COVID-19 safety policy or practice is not being followed, you should report the incident to your supervisor, academic leader, or via the University of Chicago Accident Incident Reporting (UCAIR).

University Measures for Testing and Contact Tracing
While some of the measures for Autumn Quarter call for our community’s adherence to health and safety requirements, they must be combined with institutional measures to test, trace, isolate, and treat COVID-19 cases that may emerge. These procedures include provisions for mandatory and voluntary testing, a Contact Tracing Team, guidelines for isolation and quarantine, and resources for treatment of COVID-19 cases. FAQs are available with further information.

The University’s testing approach includes three programs: (1) A Symptomatic Testing Program for individuals who have potential symptoms of COVID-19 or may have been in close contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19; (2) A Mandatory Surveillance Testing Program for asymptomatic students and other members of our campus community living in University residence halls, as well as in-season student-athletes who live off campus; and (3) A Voluntary Surveillance Testing Program for faculty, other academic appointees, postdoctoral researchers, and staff who will regularly be on our campus.
