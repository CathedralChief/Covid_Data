On-Campus Students

1. What is the Bowdoin Residential Community Agreement?
The residential community agreement aims to lay out the essential need to focus on the common good and the standards by which we will keep our community safe so that we can continue some in-person operations during the 2020–2021 academic year. Students in residence must comply with the residential community agreement as well as any other policies governing student conduct. Please refer to Dean Lohmann's message with more information about the residential community agreement.

2. What are the Campus Status Levels (CSL) and what do they mean?
Bowdoin College has developed a system of status levels that will give guidance to movement and activity on campus. The status levels are determined by the confirmed rolling seven-day positive cases, percent of those positive cases linked to other known cases as an indicator of uncontrolled spread, usage of our dedicated isolation beds, the percentage of missed COVID-19 tests by students and employees, and evidence that the Bowdoin community is disregarding masking, distancing, and other behavioral protocols, as well as other factors in the local midcoast community, including intensive care unit and inpatient bed availability for COVID-19 patients at local hospitals. Full details about the CSL are available in the Campus Guide to Fall 2020.

6. If Bowdoin has to close down, do students that have tested positive for COVID-19 also have to evacuate within three days (even though they would be spreading the virus while traveling)?
If this unfortunate situation were to unfold, the College will get guidance from the Maine CDC.
Student Life

1. Why are first-year students able to have cars this semester?
The College has chosen to forego its normal first-year student vehicle prohibition and permit first-year students to have cars on campus during the Fall 2020 semester specifically to facilitate a timely departures should a campus closure become necessary.

Housing/Residential

Are there be fridges available for student rooms this fall?
Bowdoin has provided fridges for all first-year dorm rooms. The fridges are of varying capacities and some have microwaves attached. All fridges were randomly assigned.

Paper bags and biodegradable plastic bags are available to make it easy for students to transport their food from the dining halls.

Menus are posted at the queuing lines and on our website, and we encourage students to preview the menus before they arrive.

If students miss their scheduled meal block, they are asked to wait until the end of the meal period or when the checker determines there is a space in the queue. This semester there are no other dining options available, so if a student has an ongoing schedule conflict, they should contact Dining Director Ken Cardone at kcardone@bowdoin.edu or call (207) 725-3208.

Entrances, queuing space, and exits will be adjusted to address distancing guidelines. Most dining seating has been removed to enable six-foot spacing and to allow the extra space required for dining staff workspace allowances. Plexiglass barriers have been installed at strategic locations.

13. What if I forget my ID card?

22. Does dining service have student jobs available?
We don’t anticipate being able to have students working with dining this fall. Our regular dining staff has been trained in the many new protocols and procedures required to maintain safe meal service during the pandemic, and it would require significant training to have students trained as well. We will miss our student employees very much, and we look forward to having them back with us as soon as possible.

23. What procedures are in place to keep the students and staff safe? 
Dining employees have an essential role in protecting the health and safety of students who are on campus. We take seriously the responsibility of providing a safe and healthy meal service for students and protecting the safety of the dining staff, and we have implemented processes and procedures to promote a safe environment during this health emergency.
