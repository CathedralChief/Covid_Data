THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW ENGLAND (UNE) IS PLEASED TO PRESENT THIS PLAN FOR RESUMING ON-CAMPUS OPERATIONS FOR ACADEMIC YEAR (AY) 2020-21. This plan provides important information about UNE’s implementation of the framework for reopening Maine’s higher education institutions, which was developed in the spring of 2020 through a partnership of all of Maine’s private colleges, the University of Maine System, and the Community College System: Sustaining Higher Education and Sustaining Maine: A Framework for Reopening Maine’s Colleges and Universities in Fall 2020. This framework served as a guiding foundation for UNE’s planning efforts. The highest priority of UNE’s plan is maintaining the health and safety of the University’s students, faculty, and professional staff, while recognizing that our community, like our state and nation more broadly, cannot completely eliminate risks associated with the COVID-19 virus until an effective vaccine is available. Our plan reflects the complexity of UNE as an institution and its diverse array of programs – from Humanities to Marine Science to Osteopathic Medicine. The plan is inherently flexible, allowing the University to pivot quickly in response to changing conditions in Maine, the region, the nation, and at UNE’s study abroad locations. In this context, several other resources inform this plan, including, but not limited to, the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Maine CDC, the World Health Organization, the State of Maine Office of the Governor, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), the evolving science on COVID-19, and emerging best practices in higher education. A group of administrators, faculty, and professional staff have been working diligently since April 2020 to develop this plan and remains engaged in implementing and updating it. With its array of graduate and professional programs that run throughout the calendar year, UNE welcomed back students in June on both the Biddeford and Portland campuses. Likewise, faculty with research laboratories began returning to campus in June and continued to do so throughout the summer months. The experiences of the students, faculty, and professional staff in the College of Dental Medicine, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Westbrook College of Health Professions, and the Office of Research and Scholarship have allowed us to further refine this plan in preparation for the new and returning undergraduate and graduate students in fall 2020. UNE’s mission to prepare students to thrive in a rapidly-changing world and, in so doing, to improve the health of people, communities, and our planet could not be more relevant than today. The plan reflects this core mission and is a living document. The University continues to plan for various scenarios related to changing conditions in Maine, the region, and at UNE’s study abroad locations. If restrictions continue to improve, UNE will remain vigilant in its gradual and cautious approach to relaxing any of its policies and procedures related to the pandemic. The University is also well-prepared and positioned, because of its experience in March 2020, to quickly pivot in the other direction by enhancing restrictions, including shifting again to a fully remote operations model, should that need arise. We know some of the decisions we have made may need to be revisited and revised in the future, and there are questions yet to answer. As such, we will continue to update this plan throughout the coming months to include evolving information from government agencies, the scientific literature, and the higher education community. The current plan is for the University’s academic calendar for 2020-21 for undergraduates to remain as previously published with the exceptions noted below. This calendar is subject to change depending on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. The schedule of classes for fall 2020 and related room assignments were reviewed to ensure that the public health and safety parameters outlined later in this plan can be maintained. Every effort has been made to minimize disruption in the existing schedule to students and faculty. However, a number of adjustments were needed to accommodate the additional sections required to maintain social distancing in classrooms and teaching labs, which have necessitated an approximately 40% reduction in classroom capacity overall. Students and faculty were notified well in advance of the start of classes about any alterations in their schedules that were necessary due to the modifications in classroom capacity. (See Section III. A for more information about the curriculum delivery plan and class schedule.) Clinical practica schedules for the various health professions programs involve student placements at clinical sites across the United States. The schedules for students in these programs are coordinated and managed at the individual program level, as external program accreditation standards and regulatory body guidelines vary across state lines. The faculty and professional staff who oversee the clinical education components of the curriculum communicate directly with the students about any modifications to their practica schedules. Again, it may be necessary to make other adjustments to class schedules over time, depending on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. All campus facilities and operations have been designed to ensure compliance with the CDC’s 6-foot social distancing guideline where possible. Ground and floor markings, placed to maintain six-foot (ft.) separation between individuals, were positioned in known congestion areas to help guide and ensure appropriate social distancing. All classroom furniture seating has been adjusted to accommodate a 6-ft. separation between individuals. In undergraduate science teaching laboratories that have fixed furniture arrangements, such as biology and chemistry labs, maximum class sizes have been set to maintain the 6-ft. distancing requirement. As noted above, class section sizes needed to be adjusted accordingly, which may have resulted in changes to students’ schedules. (See Section III for more information regarding delivery of the curriculum). Dining areas and other public seating spaces have been furnished to allow for the physical distancing requirements. All students and employees are expected to remain in compliance with the maximum group size parameters outlined in the Governor’s Gradual Plan to Restart Maine’s Economy. All University operations and shared office spaces have been reviewed to limit the density of individuals to the extent possible. This has been achieved through a variety of solutions including, but not limited to, remote work for all or part of the duties of some employees, flexible/ staggered work scheduling, the use of plexiglass shielding as dictated by the specific student- facing needs of the department/area, and the re-purposing of small and large conference rooms to achieve social distancing targets. The use of Zoom videoconferencing technology is expected for all meetings whenever possible, including large meetings such as the monthly meeting of the University Faculty Assembly. B. RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF CAMPUS FACILITIES To the extent possible, services for students have been designed to provide flexibility for access. For example, student academic support, counseling, student access, student health, and financial aid services are all available in both face-to-face and virtual modalities, e.g. through Zoom or other online platforms. At the same time, the ability to maintain the health and safety of our community necessitates some limitations in hours of operation of some buildings, such as the libraries, the Ripich Commons, and athletic facilities, as well as the need for specific traffic flow patterns. Specifics are discussed throughout this plan and are directly communicated to UNE community members and any visitors to campus. Signage throughout the campuses also helps inform everyone about traffic flow and facility restrictions. C. CLEANING AND DISINFECTION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES UNE follows CDC guidelines for enhanced cleaning and disinfection practices in all campus facilities using products that meet EPA’s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and are appropriate for the particular surfaces. Campus common areas, including common areas of the residence halls, such as restrooms, elevators, and reception areas, and other frequently touched surfaces are being cleaned at increased intervals by our Campus Services professional staff, including the use of an electrostatic sanitation system (commonly referred to as a portable misting/fogging system). Sanitation stations with equipment, supplies, product information, and usage guidelines are located in centralized areas of each building. Any member of the UNE community may request proper sanitation training through Housekeeping Services. Employees are expected to clean and disinfect their personal work area daily. Any frequently touched areas should be cleaned with a household disinfectant or 70% alcohol cleaner. This includes computer workstations, keyboards, mouse and trackpad devices, desks, phones, door handles, and any other frequently touched areas. Sanitation stations with equipment, supplies, product information, and usage guidelines are located in centralized areas of each building. Trash receptacles have been placed in the hallways and outside office/work areas, and they are emptied by Housekeeping. Employees are also expected to regularly clean their face coverings or face shields (see Section D. 1 below for more information about face masks). Enhanced cleaning and disinfection protocols are also being used for athletic facilities, such as the strength and conditioning, locker, and athletic training rooms. These protocols include self-service options for occupants, who are provided with equipment and materials, as well as daily deep sanitation by misting with electrostatically charged EPA registered disinfectants. University fleet vehicles are sanitized by Facilities between uses by different drivers. Sanitization consists of cleaning of touched surfaces or misting as required. The contracted transportation companies, including the Portland Campus Shuttle and the Biddeford Campus to Biddeford Shuttle, use their sanitation protocols as approved by the State. In consideration of the State of Maine and CDC guidelines regarding the use of masks, the University requires the use of cloth face masks at all times (indoors and outdoors) with the following exceptions: Employees and students are expected to wash their hands (at least 20 seconds of washing with soap and water) on a regular basis throughout the day, particularly when arriving and leaving campus, after touching their face, touching communal surfaces, coughing or sneezing, or using bathroom facilities. Hand sanitizer stations are also available at multiple locations across the campuses. Employees and students are encouraged to cough or sneeze into their elbow or use a tissue, covering both their mouth and nose, and then immediately wash their hands as described above To the extent possible, designation of certain doorways as points of entry and others as points of exit are to be followed. Right-lane traffic patterns (similar to vehicular traffic) are encouraged throughout all buildings ?In an effort to safeguard the UNE community against the threat of COVID-19 infection and transmission, we have developed a 4-tiered testing program that includes initial broad-based entry testing, ongoing symptomatic testing, focused surveillance testing of asymptomatic individuals, and testing of campus wastewater. Baseline and surveillance testing will be conducted in partnership with the Broad Institute in Cambridge, MA. Students with symptoms that might be the result of COVID infection will be tested with a point-of-care system on campus. All confirmatory testing will be done in partnership with MaineHealth’s NorDx laboratories. Upon return to campus this fall semester, all undergraduate students were required to bring evidence of a negative viral test taken within 72 hours of arrival, and were tested again shortly after arrival. Please note that there are two types of tests: antibody and viral. UNE required the viral test. Information about the difference between the two types of tests may be found on the CDC’s website. UNE encouraged students to communicate with their primary care physicians and local testing sites about test availability as the fall semester approached. We informed them that the website get-tested-covid19.org and other online resources provide lists of testing facilities based on address. We also informed them of an at-home test option that provides a fast turnaround time that is available to college students returning to campus. Because the average turnaround time for tests in some students’ areas exceeded 72 hours, we encouraged those students to plan ahead and get the test sooner and then to self-quarantine until results were received. After receiving a negative result, students were required to continue to self-quarantine until they arrived on campus.This broad-based testing provided critical baseline data that helped to inform our subsequent testing protocols. The student health center provide ongoing testing for all students who develop respiratory or other symptoms that might reflect COVID infection. UNE is not testing employees. Early detection of illness can prevent the spread of COVID-19 within the UNE community. All community members are expected to monitor their health daily. Students and employees are expected to stay home or in their dorm room if they are sick and if any of the following symptoms or circumstances apply to them UNE expects the entire community of faculty, professional staff, and students to confirm their commitment to the campus-wide COVID-19 rules of community engagement regarding social distancing, masking, enhanced hygiene, testing, symptom checking, and contact tracing. This is included as part of the online training described above. All members of the UNE community are expected to honor their commitment to the University’s COVID-19 policies as they return to campus with the understanding that policies may change as regulatory or pandemic public health advisories evolve throughout the academic year. Violations of UNE policies and protocols related to COVID-19 may subject individuals to discipline or other actions, including but not limited to removal from campus. Please note that as of September 16, 2020, all students who have found themselves in a situation in which they might have been at higher risk for contracting the virus are encouraged to voluntarily go to the Student Health Center on either campus to be tested, free of charge. All students are encouraged to take advantage of this resource without repercussions. Students who volunteer for such testing will be granted immunity from any potential conduct violations related to the activity that puts them at increased risk. For example, students who volunteer that they have attended an off-campus gathering and who seek testing will not be punished for revealing their attendance at the gathering. Likewise, any other individuals, identified by the volunteer(s), or others, as participating in such an event through a contract tracing process, will also be exempted from conduct violation processes in order to accurately ascertain the extent of the potential exposure. We are taking this approach to encourage students to come forward for testing as needed, without fear of incurring conduct violations, in order to prioritize the health of our community. (See Section II.G.4. for more information about voluntary testing and for a list of examples of high risk situations.) Our primary goals for all our athletics and recreation planning are to offer the highest quality of student experience possible while balancing the health and safety of our students, athletics staff, and others in our community. In addition to our own deliberations, we are guided by recommendations from governmental agencies and professional organizations, including the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA), the state and federal Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the National Athletic Trainers Association (NATA), and the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA). We also work closely with our athletic conference, the Commonwealth Coast Conference (CCC). An Athletics COVID-19 Action Team has been established consisting of the director of Athletics, UNE’s medical director, the NCAA compliance coordinator, the Faculty Athletics Representative, and representatives from Recreational Sports, Athletic Training, Strength and Conditioning, and Facilities Management, to oversee policies and procedures with respect to athletics. This group continues to make recommendations to the Provost and President regarding Athletics and related sports and recreation programs. The current plan is to maintain the on-campus residential experience for students, consistent with health and safety priorities. This plan is subject to change depending on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. UNE adopted a double-occupancy model of residential housing and eliminated all triple-occupancy options. Lounges in some dorms were converted to double- occupancy rooms to accommodate the need for additional beds. Hotel space was secured in the local community to accommodate students displaced by the need to reduce density in the traditional residence halls. As is the case in the on campus facilities, the hotel is staffed by resident advisors, and an area coordinator has been assigned to conduct office hours and serve as a liaison for students residing there. Shuttle service is provided to and from campus for students residing at the hotel. As noted in Section II. G. 8 above, a quarantine space has been designated in East Hall.
