To the community,As we prepare to welcome students, faculty, and staff to campus for the fall term, members of the COVID-19 Task Force are working hard to ensure that Dartmouth is implementing extensive protocols designed to support a safe environment where everyone can thrive. The health and well-being of our community members remain our highest priorities. Our multi-pronged health and safety plan for reopening the campus includes strategies to limit the introduction of COVID-19 to our community through testing, travel restrictions, and arrival quarantine requirements. Our plan includes public health practices and protocols to promote everyone's health throughout the term with face-covering and physical distancing protocols, ongoing surveillance testing, tracking of cases, specially designated quarantine and isolation housing for students, and community expectations that all students are expected to sign. By adhering to these requirements, we all play a role in preserving the Dartmouth experience for one another. Planning details can be found on the COVID-19 website. TRAVEL AND POST-TRAVEL QUARANTINE GUIDELINESBecause of the close personal interactions that are often unavoidable on Dartmouth's campus--such as students living in residence halls, researchers working in labs, and students and employees working together in classrooms--Dartmouth has established travel and post-travel guidelines that are aligned with and sometimes exceed those prescribed by the state of New Hampshire. Everyone in our community who is returning to, or arriving at, Dartmouth during the 2020–2021 academic year, including all students, will be expected to follow these travel and post-travel quarantine guidelines, which can be found in detail at:Student Quarantine GuidelinesStudent and Employee Travel GuidelinesStaff and faculty who have questions about these policies should contact the Office of Human Resources at (603) 646-3411 or human.resources@dartmouth.edu.Students should contact their dean's office.REMAINING VIGILANTDespite success in reducing the rate of virus transmission across the state, New Hampshire continues to see new cases of individuals with COVID-19 and has begun to experience a slight increase in cases overall. Please remember to wear proper face coverings at all times when using or accessing shared or communal spaces and also when a minimum of 6 feet of physical distancing is difficult to maintain. Please also continue to use hand sanitizer, wash your hands thoroughly and frequently, limit gatherings to nine or fewer people, and avoid touching your face. This virus will be with us for some time to come.MOVING TO THE NEXT LEVEL OF ACCESSStarting next week on Wed., Aug. 19, Dartmouth will move to the next level ("limited access") in our operational guidelines, assuming that local transmission rates remain at current levels. At this level, activities that cannot effectively be performed at home are allowed on-site with approval and those who can continue to work remotely should do so (speak with your supervisor if this is a challenge). All offices and departments will follow a reopening checklist approved by divisional leadership. Learn more about the guidelines.As part of moving to this level, we are introducing a telehealth service that will be available for all faculty and staff to help screen for COVID-19. Students already have access to Dick's House to perform this service. The service will be integrated into the daily Temperature Self-Assessment (TSA) for all faculty and staff coming to campus and will provide a medical screening for anyone who has COVID-19-related symptoms or was potentially exposed to someone who has COVID-19. This telehealth service will offer COVID-19 testing for those who have symptoms or who have experienced potential exposure to COVID-19. In addition to testing for those with symptoms or potential exposure, we will also be performing an initial COVID-19 test for any student-facing employee. Employees to be tested will be contacted by their supervisor regarding scheduling. Additional details about the COVID-19 telehealth service and employee testing will be provided next week.To date, Dartmouth has performed COVID-19 tests for approximately 600 graduate and professional students arriving on campus for the fall term and has not received any positive results.COMMUNITY EXPECTATIONSCOVID-19 may occur in our community this year, and it will only be through the mutual promises we make to one another to adhere to institutional policies and public health practices and standards that we can hope to contain the virus and move toward a return to a robust and energized on-campus environment. To that end, all students are being asked to sign a document detailing a series of policies that clarify our community expectations and commit to following those standards while in our community. Employees are also required to follow similar policies with respect to wearing face coverings, physical distancing, testing, and related requirements.WINTER TERM TRAVEL PROGRAMS CANCELEDIn light of the continued risk to participants' health and safety and restrictions on travel and mobility, Dartmouth has made the decision to cancel all structured winter term international programs through March 1, 2021, for undergraduate, graduate, and professional school students. This includes language study abroad, foreign study programs (as previously announced on July 22 during the Dartmouth Community Conversation), winter exchange programs, and all Dartmouth-supported leave-term programs such as internships and fellowships. Students are encouraged to consider remote/virtual leave-term opportunities until travel can resume. Other Dartmouth-supported graduate and professional school international travel programs and overseas clinical electives are also canceled. Domestic clinical rotations through Geisel will proceed as planned. Decisions about travel over March break will be communicated at a later date. Dartmouth continues to restrict all Dartmouth-sponsored international and domestic travel outside of New Hampshire and Vermont.As we prepare to welcome students back to campus, and as long as COVID-19 is present, we will continue to work to de-densify the campus as much as possible. Given the risk of transmission and restrictions on travel, we must emphasize that visitors who have not received specific authorization to be here should not come to campus, including children and family members. We appreciate everyone's cooperation in keeping our on-campus population as low as possible to help safeguard Dartmouth and the Upper Valley.These are stressful times for everyone, no matter their situation, and we are all experiencing the toll of COVID-19. Please do not hesitate to seek support through Dartmouth resources. And remember to take time to reach out to colleagues, neighbors, and friends. Life holds many challenges right now and we understand that everyone is trying their best. This is hard, but together we can do it.Last week, we told you that we were going to pause and carefully review our plan to bring undergraduates to campus for the fall term. We listened as many of you--students, faculty, staff, parents, and Upper Valley community members--expressed your preference for how we should proceed. We have heard you and considered your arguments and understandable concerns.We have also evaluated our plan considering the most relevant experiences of our peers. While the return of students has gone smoothly at many institutions, others have been forced to close their campuses quickly because of COVID-19 outbreaks. One thing is clear from our conversations with you and from our peers' experiences: No decision at this time, during the pandemic, will satisfy everyone.We have, however, made the decision that we think honors our mission while implementing safeguards for the protection of our community. After much careful consideration, we have decided to move forward with our plan to return approximately half of our undergraduate student body to Dartmouth, beginning Sept. 8.As a residential college with a mission to deliver the world's premier liberal arts education in a close-knit, vibrant community in a setting ideal for learning and reflection, we are committed to making on-campus learning happen for as many of our students as possible. We believe our reopening plan, announced earlier this summer, allows us to do this, giving most undergraduates the chance to be on campus for some portion of the coming academic year, while continuing to provide high-quality instruction to all students, regardless of location. It also allows us to provide students with more resources to complete their work, which some may not have at home.Our goal is to manage our plan effectively and safely while respecting and sustaining the hard work the Upper Valley has done to flatten the curve. We recognize that all institutions of higher education are dealing with the same virus, but each of us is managing a unique set of variables when it comes to the transmission and spread of COVID-19. A number of schools, particularly in New England, have opened using strategies and tactics similar to ours and have not experienced significant outbreaks. Our plan is science-based and data-driven and it leverages our rural setting and comparatively low population.Our plan provides for pre-arrival testing for domestic undergraduate students approved to live off and on campus for the fall term; testing on arrival and on days three and seven for all students; 14 days of quarantine following arrival; wastewater monitoring of residential buildings; regular surveillance testing throughout the term; a required daily temperature and symptom self-assessment screening for all students, faculty, and staff entering campus buildings; restrictions on the size of groups that may meet, a hygiene campaign, and a mandatory face-covering policy; and clear community expectations that all enrolling students are expected to sign as a condition for access to campus.We recognize that it is impossible to project the progression of this disease over the coming months. For that reason, we will remain attentive to the number of positive tests in our campus population relative to the surrounding region, the rate of change in numbers of positive tests, the availability of sufficient quarantine and isolation capacity in our system, and the status of local health care systems in assessing our continued operation.While setting a threshold to adjust our plan based on an absolute number of cases on campus does not take into account important factors such as identifiable risks or whether cases were part of a containable cluster, we will use a 1% positivity rate in our testing cohort--largely undergraduates--in any given week as a trigger for an immediate review of our in-person operational status.Beginning next week, we will share information on a dashboard on our COVID-19 website to allow community members to view the metrics we will use to evaluate whether a transition back to fully remote learning will be required. The dashboard will include the number of tests administered, positive cases, and quarantine and isolation information. To date, we have tested 1,015 graduate and professional students and have not identified any positive cases of the virus.We expect that there will be challenges and setbacks along the way. Having students back on campus will only work if we are all invested in our success and committed to doing our part to protect the health and safety of every person. Each of us will need to continue to sacrifice our personal preferences and interests to prioritize the health of our friends, colleagues, and community members.And to our students, you are vital members of our beloved Dartmouth community. Along with faculty, staff and alumni, we believe in you and have great confidence in your ability to meet this moment. We look forward to partnering with you to carry out our plan. And, most importantly, we look forward to welcoming you to campus.With graduate and professional school students already in the Upper Valley and just under half of the undergraduate population arriving next week, we'd like to highlight important aspects of our health and safety plan, which we need your help in carrying out as we work to protect those in our community from COVID-19.Face coverings must be worn indoors at all times except when you are alone in a private space, such as your dorm room or office, or when you are eating. That means in hallways, conference rooms, classrooms, and entryways--masks should be worn in any and all spaces whenever another person could be present, even if you are initially in that space alone. If you see someone not wearing a mask in such a space, consider asking them to "please mask up." Masks should also be worn outdoors on campus and in Hanover, in accordance with the town's mask ordinance.Please maintain physical distancing of at least 6 feet between yourself and others at all times, both indoors and outside.Please note the requirements in our travel and quarantine policies. We continue to benefit from extremely low rates of virus transmission in the Upper Valley. Our testing and quarantine plan is designed to limit the transmission of the virus within our community by people arriving from outside New England. However, exposure is not limited to arrival, it includes trips within and outside of the Upper Valley, which is why we have put in place travel and quarantine policies that seek to reduce potential travel exposure.Currently, those who must travel outside New England are required to quarantine for 14 days upon their return in accordance with New Hampshire guidelines, even if they test negative for the virus before the 14 days have passed. Since the significance of a test showing that you've had the virus—an antibody test—is unclear at this time, a positive antibody test does not affect the quarantine requirement or its duration. During the quarantine period access to the campus is prohibited. Dartmouth's quarantine requirements may be updated if New Hampshire's guidelines change.Concerns about violations of our COVID-19 policies by members of the Dartmouth community may be reported using this form. Please note that this is not an emergency response tool.Employee testing formally began yesterday and will continue for baseline testing through the month of September and then continue with ongoing surveillance testing throughout the term. Faculty and staff who have been identified as those needing to work on campus during fall term will be notified by email to schedule their test. Employees who have questions about testing should contact Human Resources at (603) 646-3411 or human.resources@dartmouth.edu.As part of our comprehensive COVID-19 testing program, and to keep you informed, we have launched a tracking dashboard. Visit our tracking dashboard to see how many people in the Dartmouth community have been tested, find overall testing results, and see how many individuals on our campus are in isolation or quarantining. In addition, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services has launched a dashboard of current cases and outbreaks for all schools in the state.We know this remains a challenging time and we thank you for doing your part to help protect our community.
