Purpose and Origin of the Protocols The COVID-19 pandemic imposes serious health risks to healthy students, to vulnerable members of the campus community, to the Durham community and to students’ families and home communities. These risks are well documented, not subject to serious scientific dispute and therefore will not be cataloged in detail here. The University is a residential living and learning environment, where the challenges of managing community spread are made greater by a number of factors, including the difficulty of: (a) maintaining safe physical distance in classrooms, laboratories, recreational areas and living spaces; (b) providing effective barriers to air-borne droplets carrying the virus in those spaces; and (c) the highly variable impacts of the virus on persons who spread it. A substantial body of expert opinion has asserted that institutions like this one should remain closed. Another substantial body of expert opinion has asserted that keeping institutions like this one closed will harm our students and our communities for years to come. As a result, the University committed a vast amount of human effort to create procedures and protocols that follow the best available guidance to create conditions for reopening this campus and keeping it open. The persons who developed these protocols recognized that the state of knowledge about the COVID-19 virus is rapidly evolving and best practices for preventing community spread and protecting vulnerable persons is also changing quickly. Accordingly, the University President, in consultation with faculty, staff and community members, has reserved the right to modify these protocols as needed. Safety Rules [Note: Listed below are the general safety rules that all students are expected to follow. At the end of this document, the University has provided detailed explanations of these rules and how they will apply.] All students should prepare to do the following before and after they arrive on campus for the Fall Semester of 2020: Wear masks or face coverings when inside all campus buildings and outside on campus and in the downtown Durham area when physical distancing is not possible. The exceptions are private rooms in residence halls and campus-owned housing.Comply with posted signs, syllabus statements, and published safety rules prescribing physical distancing, frequent handwashing, and hand sanitizer use. ?Comply with directives from the NH Governor, their classroom faculty, and University administrators. ?Not host, organize, attend improper parties or gatherings (see below for description of specific rules about permissible and improper gatherings).. ?Not have any guests in their University owned residential facilities who are not current UNH students. ?Comply with all University testing requirements. ?Adhere to all rules in the Student Code of Conduct ?Enforcement Procedures This is a university campus. Our goal is to be mutually welcoming, inclusive, and educative. In that spirit, all students, faculty, and staff should expect to be reminded to observe the safety rules established in these protocols and should politely acknowledge any reminder. The principal purpose of these enforcement procedures is to achieve prompt, effective compliance with public health and safety rules. Any member of the University community or the public may report concerns about possible violations of these protocols. ?Failure to follow the safety rules in this protocol may be documented in a complaint to the Dean of Students office. The complaint shall identify, where possible, the student, the date, the approximate time, the place, and the safety rule(s) that were violated. If this is not the first reminder or violation, the complaint shall include the number of occasions that the student was reminded of or violated the safety rules. ?If the conduct alleged against the student would violate both the Safety Rules outlined here and also violate any of the rules in the Student Code of Conduct, the Dean has the discretion to resolve the matter under the procedures described here or the procedures described in the Student Code). ?If at any point in this process the Dean determines that the alleged conduct could warrant sanctions such as eviction or suspension (or equally serious consequences), the Dean will refer the matter to Community Standards where it will be resolved using the ordinary conduct process. ?The Dean, the Dean’s designee, or the student’s associate dean will meet with the student. The purpose of the meeting is to allow the student to be heard on the complaint. Meetings are subject to this procedure: Complaint received and reviewed for completeness Complaint and meeting notice provided to student by email. The contents of the complaint will be presumed accurate and reliable, subject to the ?student’s right to establish that the presumption does not apply on the facts and ?circumstances present. ?The student will have the opportunity at the meeting to provide information (and ?other evidence) about the allegations and to discuss whether the student should be found responsible. ?The Dean, the Dean’s designee or the associate dean shall make a finding of responsibility. ?If the student is found responsible, sanctions will be imposed as described below. ?Sanctions. Sanctions shall be proportional to the alleged violation. Each case will be evaluated individually according to the facts of that case and student could receive a combination of sanctions (which could include sanctions not listed below). Also, students should be aware that they are subject to all the rules in the Student Code and that certain conduct described here could also violate other rules that might have different sanctions. ?Warning and educational meeting. This sanction generally applies to students who have not received a warning in the past but have needed to be reminded to wear a mask or to distance themselves properly physically from others. Probation (3 months) and educational meeting. This sanction generally applies (1) to students who have already had a warning and educational conversation but have continued to need to be reminded to wear a mask or to properly physically distance themselves from others; and (2) students who have been reminded to wear a mask or physically distance and refuse (even if they eventually comply; students are expected to follow the protocols promptly when they are reminded); (3) students who have attended an impermissible gathering; and (4) students who have hosted an impermissible gathering where the risk presented by the gathering was relatively lower (for example, a gathering of 5 people in a room where only 4 are permitted). ?Loss of privilege to be on campus or restrictions to privilege to be on campus. This could include the loss of privilege to attend live classes (subject to the student’s right and ability to participate in completing their coursework). ?Students who are found responsible for having a guest in University housing who is not a current UNH student will face eviction from housing. ?Eviction or suspension (or equally serious consequences). Any case where these sanctions may be warranted will be referred to Community Standards and will be resolved according to the conduct process outlined in the Student Code (which includes the right to a hearing before a hearing panel and the right to an appeal). ?[Notice of Three Strikes Policy: Any violation that results in a sanction other than a warning and educational conversation is considered a “strike” under the University’s Three Strikes Policy.] Failure to Properly Submit Test Samples. Students who fail to submit testing samples twice will be required to move to remote ?learning and will not be permitted on campus. Students who fail to drop off their testing sample at the required time will have a grace period of 24 hrs. If a student fails to drop off the test by the end of the 24-hr. grace period, that is considered one failure to submit a test. ?Students who intentionally submit samples that were not collected as directed/approved by the University will face sanctions that will likely include a ban from campus for a designated period of time and may face more serious consequences, such as suspension. Communication with parents. The Dean, the Dean’s designee or the associate dean may communicate with the student’s parents if they find that the student’s violation of the safety rules would constitute a risk to the health and safety of any vulnerable person who might be living in the student’s home or home community. ?
