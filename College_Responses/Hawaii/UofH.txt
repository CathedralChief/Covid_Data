Please note: the Guidelines are interim only and are subject to revision, until we can complete consultation with the stakeholders.

Purpose and Scope
To continue to provide engaging learning opportunities and advance research while limiting the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”), the university has developed these University of Hawaiʻi COVID-19 Guidelines (“Guidelines”) for campuses to follow as they welcome back students, faculty, staff and invited visitors in the upcoming academic year. These Guidelines were developed under guidance issued by local, state and federal authorities and are subject to change based on our developing knowledge of COVID-19 and evolving federal, state and county guidance.

Additionally, the following publications have served and will continue to serve as valuable resources: U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) Guidelines for Reopening Colleges and Universities, CDC Guidance for Cleaning and Disinfecting (Public Spaces, Workplaces, etc.), CDC Considerations for Institutes of Higher Education, Guidelines for Opening Up America Again, State of Hawaiʻi Beyond Recovery (PDF), Hawaiʻi State Department of Health (“DOH”) guidance on what to do if you test positive for COVID-19 (PDF), a person at your worksite tests positive for COVID-19 (PDF), or you have been tested for COVID-19 (PDF), and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Guidance on Preparing Workplaces for COVID-19 (PDF).

These Guidelines provide a framework for university campuses to resume on-site delivery of classes, advising, student services, research, and other activities. Ultimately, all members of the UH community—students, faculty, staff and visitors alike—must also take responsibility for their own health and safety and act in a manner that demonstrates respect and consideration for those around them. No community, particularly one as large and complex as the University of Hawaiʻi, can guarantee an environment completely free of COVID-19. But, the measures described in these Guidelines and the respective campus plans that implement these Guidelines seek to apply the latest national, state and local guidance for making our environment and activities as safe as possible and healthy as can be with the current understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic.

These Guidelines shall remain in effect until and unless superseded or revoked by the President of the university. These Guidelines apply to all university operations (except where noted), activities on the university’s campuses and at off-campus facilities (“onsite” or “facility/ies”), and all students, employees and visitors to university facilities. Based on these Guidelines, each campus will develop its own operational plan that takes into consideration its unique location, facilities, program needs and available resources. These initial Interim Guidelines are based on the current environment and guidance on COVID-19 in June 2020 and will be updated as circumstances change. Additional information for employees is available at the University Office of Human Resources website.

* All campuses will closely monitor their local conditions and surroundings. They will be prepared to alter operations and services in a timely and appropriate manner in response to COVID-related situations or circumstances. Additionally, the University of Hawaiʻi continues to work closely with county and state officials to operate in accordance with government orders, recommendations from the Hawaiʻi Department of Health, and CDC Guidelines.
Not Permitted on Campus
If you have tested positive for COVID-19, stay at home (PDF) except to get medical care. Do not return to campus until you have been cleared to return by the DOH.
If you are subject to government-issued or a healthcare provider’s orders to quarantine, stay at home.
If you have been identified through contact tracing to be tested for COVID-19, stay at home (PDF) until you receive a negative test result.
If a member of your household has tested positive for or you have been notified that you had close contact with a person with COVID-19 then stay at home.
If you are sick at all, stay at home, even if you only have mild symptoms of illness that could be COVID-19, which include the following: 1) cough; 2) shortness of breath; 3) sore throat; 4) diarrhea; 5) loss of smell or taste; 6) fever (>100.4° F) or feeling feverish; 7) chills; and/or 8) body aches. Contact your medical provider and follow their advice including about when to return to campus.
All students, employees and visitors to whom this section applies must follow the reporting procedure set forth in Campus Official(s) and Communications Protocols.
If you are an employee required to stay at home under these guidelines, contact your supervisor regarding telework options or available leave.
Any student, employee or visitor who has been required to stay at home under these guidelines shall not return to campus until cleared to return by a healthcare professional or DOH.
Hygiene and Respiratory Etiquette
Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially:
after wiping or blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing;
after returning from a public place or shared common area/space (e.g., classroom, conference room, break room or lunch room);
after touching trash or objects frequently used by others (such as handrails, door handles, and elevator buttons);
after using the toilet;
before, during, and after preparing food; and
before and after work breaks and work shifts.
Use hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Do not touch your face with your hands.
Cough or sneeze into your elbow or a disposable tissue or cloth.
Avoid sharing or using communal items (such as office supplies) and objects that are not easily cleaned or disinfected (such as fabric).
Face Coverings
Please note: the Guidelines are interim only and are subject to revision, until we can complete consultation with stakeholders.

All employees, students and visitors are required to wear face coverings as recommended by the CDC onsite when interacting in-person with others.
Employees, students and visitors are expected to wear face coverings as recommended by the CDC when indoors (e.g., classrooms, laboratories, shops, and common spaces such as hallways and elevators) and where physical distancing is not possible.
Employees and students are not required to wear face coverings where they are able to practice safer physical distancing AND are working or studying in isolation or are outdoors in uncrowded areas.
* Face coverings should be worn and made in accordance with the CDC guidelines.
Residents of University student housing are required to wear face coverings in common spaces of all residential buildings, including but not limited to lobbies, hallways, lounges, eating spaces, etc. Residents are not required to wear a face covering when in their own living space, including bedrooms, suites, or apartments. However, if residents are feeling ill, they should wear face coverings at all times.
The university recognizes that there are certain instances where wearing a face covering may not be feasible or, if you have a medical condition or disability, where wearing a face covering poses a health or safety risk. Reasonable accommodations will be made in those instances. Children under the age of 5 are not required to wear face masks.
Members of the University community with a documented disability or medical condition that affects their ability to wear a face covering may request accommodations or supportive measures from the University. The University will work together with the individual with the goal of creating equal access without putting the safety and welfare of other community members at risk. Those with particular needs for accommodations or supportive measures should contact the Disability Service Office, the ADA Coordinator’s Office, or their departmental HR representative.
Because face coverings are critical to preventing the spread of COVID-19 per CDC guidelines, the university views non-compliance as a very serious matter and fully expects that all employees will cooperate and want to do their part to make our campuses safer. In the event an employee is not willing to wear a mask and does not have a legitimate medical reason that prevents them from wearing a face covering, the employee shall be removed from campus pursuant to the disciplinary schedule and additional information on the OHR website.
Faculty who teach in person and employees providing direct service to customers (in which physical distancing is not easy to manage, such as at a customer service window) will be provided face shields. Face Shields should only be used in combination with and not as a substitute for face coverings. The CDC does not recommend use of face shields for normal everyday activities in place of cloth or disposable face coverings, mostly because there is not enough evidence that the face shield alone prevents the spray of respiratory particles via a cough, sneeze, speaking loudly, etc. from spreading outside the face shield. For those using a face shield as an accommodation, additional measures should be in place such as increased distancing.
Note: Face coverings, masks, or respirators with exhalation valves should be avoided as they do not protect others from expelled respiratory droplets and aerosols.

Definitions
Cloth face covering includes manufactured or homemade masks, bandanas, or bandanas that cover the nose and mouth with at least two layers of fabric and do not have an exhalation valve (raised plastic cylinder meant for easy exhalation). Cloth face coverings should be made from washable materials and should be laundered regularly. In support of sustainability efforts, the University encourages use of reusable face coverings.

Disposable mask includes non-surgical, surgical or dust masks that cover the nose and mouth. Disposable masks do not include masks with exhalation valves (raised plastic cylinders meant for easy exhalation).

Face covering refers to cloth face coverings and disposable masks.

N95, N99 or N100 masks are respiratory protection devices that are tight-fitting and filters at least 95%, 99% and 99.97%, respectively of particles and droplets. Use of these masks should be reserved for healthcare and emergency responders and those who have been required to do so as part of a specific job task, such as research with SARS CoV-2. OSHA standards require medical clearance, fit-testing, and training at least annually when these masks are required.

See FAQs for face coverings.

Practice Physical Distancing
Wherever possible, the following physical distancing practices should be adhered to:

stay at least 6 feet from others;
avoid gathering in groups or crowds; and
if using an elevator, face coverings are required and occupants must adhere to posted occupancy limits.
Avoid All Non-Essential Travel
Consult local and national travel advisories for any travel restrictions.
As travel restrictions are subject to change at any moment, be prepared for unanticipated quarantine requirements, which may prevent you from returning to campus.
Employees shall additionally consult the university’s Travel Information.
Get a Flu Shot
Getting a flu shot will not protect against COVID-19, but may help reduce your chances of catching the flu or another influenza-like illness which may be mistaken for COVID-19 and/or hinder a diagnosis.
Campus Official(s) and Communication Protocols
All campuses shall clearly designate and publish their designated campus official(s) for students, employees and visitors to report to if they:
have tested positive for COVID-19;
are suspected of having COVID-19 based on their symptoms, travel history or history of prolonged contact with an individual who has tested positive for COVID-19, among other indicators; or
are subject to a quarantine.
The university and each campus will establish secure communication protocols whereby students, employees, and visitors will self-report to the campus official(s) if they have symptoms of COVID-19, a positive test for COVID-19 (PDF), had close contact with someone with COVID-19 (PDF) within the last 14 days or have been tested for COVID-19 (PDF). Communication protocols shall be in accordance with health information sharing regulations for COVID-19 and other applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and confidentiality, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) or Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”).
No one with symptoms of COVID-19 should be present onsite. If you observe anyone (including but not limited to employees, students, visitors or vendors) developing or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 onsite, notify your supervisor or your campus official(s) immediately.
Each campus must establish a protocol to follow when a student or employee develops symptoms while onsite. The student or employee must notify the campus official and for employees, their supervisor (this includes student employees) immediately. The student or employee must be safely isolated and required to leave the facility. As applicable, the campus official(s) or supervisor shall report that an employee or student has tested positive for or is suspected of having COVID-19 to their Dean/Director without disclosing the identity of the student or employee, and the Dean/Director will then report this information to an appropriate University Officer.
The university will not disclose the identity of any employee or student who is diagnosed with or is suspected of having COVID-19, except on a need-to-know basis. The university may also notify public health authorities if they learn that a student or employee has tested positive for COVID-19, and public health authorities have not already been notified, as this is a direct threat to public health.
As appropriate, students, employees and the public will be made aware if and when confirmed COVID-19 cases are present on campus (updated August 31) in the previous 14 days. Any university closures or any restrictions in place to limit COVID-19 exposure (e.g., limited hours of operation) may be communicated in a manner that balances privacy with health and safety interests. The university has established communication protocols on how a confirmed, positive case of COVID-19 on a UH campus should be announced to the respective campus community.
Campus Responsibilities to Clean and Disinfect in Cases of COVID-19 or Suspicion of COVID-19
Campuses should establish protocols for closing off areas substantially used by a person who has or is suspected of having COVID-19 and for preventing use of these areas until after cleaning and disinfecting.
Campus protocols for cleaning and disinfecting areas substantially used by a person who has or is suspected of having COVID-19 should include waiting at least 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting or, if 24 hours is not feasible, waiting as long as possible.
CDC guidelines state that special protocols for cleaning and disinfecting are not necessary if an area can be closed for seven days or more.
Protocols should also ensure as safe as possible and correct use and storage of cleaning and disinfection products.
Mandatory Daily Screening and Self-Monitoring
Please note: these Guidelines are interim only and are subject to revision, until we can complete consultation with the unions.

All students, employees and visitors are required to monitor their own health daily for COVID-19 symptoms, including fatigue, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, cough, fever or feeling feverish, chills, muscle pain or body aches, sore throat, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, congestion or runny nose, headache, and a new loss of taste or smell.
Screening procedures are mandatory and apply to all students, employees and visitors reporting to a university location.
Daily screening will include a brief, mandatory questionnaire for all students, employees and visitors who plan to be onsite. The university will deploy, prior to the start of the Fall 2020 semester, a daily check-in app and/or web form to support convenient collection of the required response.
Any individual who refuses to complete screening will not be allowed onsite.
Testing will be conducted in collaboration with governmental health officials in accord with applicable rules, regulations and guidance.
Education, Training and Signage
* Each campus shall ensure that employees returning and working on their campus have completed online COVID-19 training in accordance with the State of Hawaiʻi Occupational Safety and Health requirements.
Campuses should also develop communications strategies to include messaging to promote behaviors that prevent the spread of COVID-19 among employees, students and visitors. This might include videos, infographics and text distributed on websites, in emails and on University social media accounts.
Campuses should post signs that promote safer behaviors in highly visible locations, including in classrooms, laboratories, libraries, common areas, shared spaces, restrooms, hallways, stairwells, elevators, and as needed in offices and other work locations.

Cleaning and Disinfection
Each campus shall develop and post a schedule for increased, routine cleaning and disinfection, especially for frequently touched shared surfaces (e.g., door handles, elevator buttons, faucets, paper towel dispensers) on campus at least daily or between use if feasible. Use of shared objects (e.g., lab equipment, computers) should be limited when possible, or cleaned between use.
Each campus shall develop and post a schedule for increased cleaning and disinfection for heavily utilized areas.
Campuses shall use products that meet EPA disinfection criteria and shall be mindful of any storage and ventilation considerations.
To promote healthy hygiene behaviors, campuses shall provide adequate supplies, including soap, hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, paper towels, tissues, disinfectant wipes, cloth face coverings (as feasible), face shields (as feasible and appropriate) and no-touch/foot-pedal trash cans.
Ventilation
Campuses shall monitor and maintain air conditioning units in accordance with normal operating protocols.
In facilities where air conditioning is not utilized, campuses shall develop a protocol to increase circulation of outdoor air as much as possible, for example by opening windows and doors, except where doing so poses a safety or health risk (e.g., risk of falling, triggering asthma symptoms) to those using the facility or if it would compromise research.
Modified Layouts
Wherever practical, campuses should modify all occupied spaces, including classrooms and other instructional facilities to meet the following recommendations:
Space seating/desks at least 6 feet apart.
Where furniture is fixed, block off and clearly mark seating that should not be utilized to allow physical distancing.
Where furniture is moveable, block off and clearly mark furniture that should not be utilized to allow physical distancing; unused chairs or tables should be moved to the room perimeter or removed from the room.
Consider turning desks to face in the same direction (rather than facing each other), or have seats arranged on only one side of tables.
Consider using a staggered layout (each row offset by 50%) to potentially increase capacity where furniture is moveable.
Configure rooms to allow at least a 6-foot buffer between the instructor and first row of students and consider using unoccupied seating/tables to provide a physical buffer.
There will be situations where physical distancing cannot be maintained. Each campus is responsible for evaluating such instances on a case-by-case basis and determining whether a classroom or office activity should continue with appropriate alternatives to physical distancing.
Physical Barriers and Guides
Where feasible, campuses should consider installing physical barriers, such as clear sneeze guards and partitions, in areas where it is difficult for individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart and/or at public-facing transaction counters (e.g., student services, mail delivery, bathroom sinks).
Where feasible, campuses should consider controlling the flow of foot-traffic in common areas to mitigate face-to-face contact or exchanges and to minimize pedestrian traffic congestion. Where lines typically form, campuses should designate with signage, tape, or by other means six-foot spacing for people in line to maintain appropriate distance.

Please note: the Guidelines are interim only and are subject to revision, until we can complete consultation with stakeholders.

Campuses should follow the Guidance for Campuses on Scheduling Fall 2020 Courses issued by the Office of the Vice President for Academic Planning and Policy.

Students should have as much opportunity as is practicable to learn in person with other students and faculty.
Classes will be scheduled online, in-person, or with a hybrid mix of the two. For a technical description of the formats campuses will use to schedule classes, please see the Course Format for Fall 2020. Each campus will inform students about changes to the format or schedule of courses for which they have registered and ensure this information is available to students making decisions about their schedules.
Decisions about which classes will be scheduled with an in-person format will be made at the campus level and will take into consideration factors such as quality of instruction, accreditation or licensure requirements, specialized resource needs, and the needs of particular student populations.
Campuses are responsible for ensuring that classes and class activities (e.g., exams, office hours, etc.) are accessible to students, and that students can achieve the same learning objectives regardless of the class format.
In person classes will meet in facilities that meet the guidelines for Facilities and Spaces. Select instruction may also take place outside when appropriate.
Campuses will develop schedules and protocols for cleaning specialized equipment used in laboratory or studio classes.
Instructors will ensure students receive appropriate preparation and guidance regarding health and safety protocols for activities such as team projects, field trips, internships or clinical placements.

Student Housing
Residential capacity will be limited as necessary to reduce the density in living spaces and to adhere to social distancing requirements.
Move-in procedures will be phased and the pace of move-in will be dependent on logistical considerations.
Recognizing the special circumstances in student housing, testing protocols must be developed for residents and employees to respond to instances of COVID-19 in a timely manner.
Isolation/quarantine protocols that comply with DOH guidance (i.e., what to do if you test positive for COVID-19 (PDF), a person at your worksite tests positive for COVID-19 (PDF), or you have been tested for COVID-19 (PDF)) must be developed for residents or employees who test positive or have been notified of close contact with a positive COVID-19 case.
Each campus should assess whether common areas in residence halls should be closed or have access limited by physical distancing protocols, group size requirements, and cleaning protocols.
Shared restrooms and communal kitchens in the residence halls will be cleaned and sanitized daily by custodial staff.
Halls in which students are responsible for their own shared areas (bathrooms, kitchens, living rooms), must be cleaned and sanitized by the residents of the unit.
Room assignments and room layouts required to comply with the above requirements are for the Fall 2020 semester. Assignments and room arrangements for the Spring 2021 semester will be announced at a later date.
Food Service
If seating for dining is available, follow the guidance for modified layouts in Facilities and Spaces, Modified Layouts, to adhere to physical distancing.
Use disposable food service items (e.g., utensils, dishes) whenever feasible. If disposable items are not feasible or desirable, ensure that all non-disposable food service items are handled with gloves and washed with dish soap and hot water or in a dishwasher. Individuals should wash their hands after removing their gloves or after directly handling used food service items.
If food is offered at any event, have pre-packaged boxes or bags for each attendee instead of a buffet or family-style meal. Avoid sharing food and utensils.
Where lines typically form, campuses or vendors shall designate with signage, tape, or by other means 6-foot spacing for people in line to maintain appropriate distance.
Student Services
Consistent with the university’s commitment to access, the services provided to students will be accessible to the greatest extent possible whether students are on campus or are studying remotely. Remote access to students should provide the same level of service as in-person offerings.
The university provides a digital platform (STAR Balance) that allows students to make appointments with staff, advisors or faculty; similar platforms are also available on some University campuses. These platforms permit students to consult with University personnel without the need to be on campus. This capability should permit students who cannot come to campus to still access faculty office hours, tutoring services, advisors, financial aid offices and other services.
Each campus shall develop plans to provide alternative ways for students who are learning remotely to participate in student activities.
Student services and activities conducted in person shall adhere to all applicable guidelines relating to physcial distancing, barriers, face coverings, sanitization and other considerations.
Events, Gatherings, and Activities (excluding classes)
Each campus shall develop procedures for requesting approval to hold events of 10 or more people.
Campus should encourage virtual group events, gatherings, activities or meetings, if feasible.
Where in-person gatherings are unavoidable, promote physical distancing of at least 6 feet between people, wear face coverings, use outdoor, well-ventilated spaces, and limit group size to the extent possible.
Limit any nonessential visitors, volunteers, and activities involving external groups or organizations as much as possible – especially with individuals who are not from the local geographic area (e.g., community, town, city, county).
Pursue options to convene sporting events and participation in sports activities in ways that minimize the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to players, coaches, staff, audiences and communities.
Use of Facilities by External (Non-University) Parties
External parties that are granted permission to share or use University facilities shall also follow these guidelines.

Office Spaces
Wherever possible, employees should work at least 6 feet from other people. To achieve this, furniture and other office equipment should be reconfigured to maximize the use of space.
If 6-foot distancing cannot be maintained within existing space, then supervisors are encouraged to consider relocation, alternating the work force between working from campus and working from home.
Staffing
*Campuses and offices are encouraged to seriously consider when possible an employee’s request to voluntarily telework, where job functions are suitable to be performed remotely and the employee can be as functional and productive as when they are in the workplace.
The university encourages units to maximize telework for employees who are members of high-risk populations as defined by the CDC. In addition, the university will provide reasonable accommodations upon request to all disabled employees that will enable the employee to perform their essential job functions.
*The Families First Coronavirus Response Act
Employees who are unable to work (or telework) for one or more of the following reasons related to COVID-19 may be eligible for emergency paid sick leave (EPSL) and/or expanded family medical leave (EFML) under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA):

You are quarantined (pursuant to a government order or advice of a health care provider);
You are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and seeking a medical diagnosis;
You have a bona fide need to care for someone subject to quarantine (pursuant to government order or advice of a health care provider);
You are caring for a child (under 18 years of age) whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19; and/or
You are experiencing a substantially similar condition to COVID-19.
Non-Discrimination/Harassment
The university values and is committed to fostering a diverse academic environment. Discrimination, harassment, and intimidation based on one’s race, national origin, ethnicity, genetic information, or any other protected characteristic, is strictly prohibited. Reports of any incident of discrimination, harassment or intimidation should follow University procedures.
