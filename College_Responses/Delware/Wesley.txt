Dear Wesley College Family,
The Coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to be in the national headlines as our network of
healthcare systems and professionals tirelessly look for a means to isolate and eradicate this
virus. Currently there are no confirmed cases of this virus on our campus, or surrounding
community, but we have taken precautionary preventive measures on campus that include
increased cleaning and sanitizing of common areas, COVID-19 information dissemination,
and formed an action group led by one of our senior Cabinet members. Wesley’s Coronavirus
Action Group (CAG) will continue to communicate with the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), state health agencies, and the other institutions of higher education, in a
joint effort to assure collectively we take all appropriate and necessary precautions to ensure
the safety of our campus community – this includes the development of contingency plans to
safeguard our campus community, while also exploring a myriad of options for course delivery
if there is an incursion of the virus in our state and community.
Our CAG will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available using several
delivery means including, campus-wide e-mails, electronic billboard postings, this website,
flyers, and social media, so we can hopefully ensure our campus community and greater
Wesley College family remains informed. There are several websites and postings dedicated
to COVID-19, and the following are a few that may help address some general questions you
may have about the virus:

Additionally, here is a short one-minute video from Christiana Care discussing preventive
measures:

We will continue to provide the safest and educationally conducive campus environment,
while at the same time doing our part with our city, county, and state agencies in preventing
and/or mitigating the spread of COVID-19 into our region. One Team…One Family…One
Future!
All The Best,

Dear Wesley College Family,

On-campus testing is now available thanks to the State’s Director of the Delaware Emergency Management Agency (DEMA), Mr. A.J. Schall, and Delaware State University’s (DSU) President, Dr. Tony Allen. All students, faculty, and staff will now be able to be tested on campus vice solely having to rely on off-campus test sites – as a reminder, testing is not optional, it is required.

In total we will eventually have ~5000 test kits, and the initial kits we are distributing for testing, ~1000 kits, are the State supplied at-home testing kits that utilize saliva collection, which has the same effectiveness as the oral swab test. This is not a nasal swab test. Instructions on what to do, and preaddressed/prepaid UPS envelopes for return to our mailroom and subsequent shipping to the test lab, are all provided. This test is performed under the supervision of a Vault healthcare provider through a video telehealth visit (explained in the instructions), eliminating the risk of person-to-person exposure to the virus, and results are usually received within 48-72 hrs. The ~4000 test kits from DSU will arrive shortly, and will not be the at-home kits like the State provided. Testing protocols, and date/times for the testing utilizing the DSU provided test kits will be provided when available. Additionally, on Wednesday, October 28th DEMA & MakoMedical will be on campus providing testing – times, and sign-up instructions will be provided next week by our COVID-19 Action Group (CAG).

In addition to on-campus testing, we will continue utilizing the community based testing sites, in our continued focused efforts to ensure, as best as possible, the safest, healthiest, and educationally conducive environment for our campus community.

We must all remain vigilant and continue to foster our culture of compliance – completing our daily COVID Pass, wearing masks, maintaining a social separation of at least six feet, washing our hands frequently, avoiding touching our faces, avoiding large gatherings, and no parties. Now is not the time to be complacent, and even if we test negative as most of us have, we still must follow all our protocols and polices to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our campus, and surrounding community.

Everyone is reminded to regularly check your Wesley email as well as our Protect Wesley webpage for the most up to date information and guidance – https://protect.wesley.edu/. Additionally, there is a “FAQs” site imbedded under the Protect Wesley Pledge section of our Protect Wesley webpage (https://protect.wesley.edu/faqs/), as well as other areas, that provides several commonly asked questions/answers.

Campus remains closed to the public unless it is a specific and College authorized event or visit.

Stay informed, stay healthy, stay positive, and stay safe while helping others that are less fortunate, as well as making a positive impact in the community you live in and serve.

For the thought of the day I will share a quote from Winston Churchill, that is worth reflecting on – “Truth is incontrovertible, panic may resent it, ignorance may deride it, malice may distort it, but there it is.”

Next Update: Update #28, October 22nd

All The Best & Go Wolverines!

The college continues to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic. We are coordinating preparedness action plans with guidance from the Delaware Department of Public Health, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Per phone conference call, the Delaware Department of Public Health has recommended all students exhibiting cold/cough/flu-like symptoms to CALL your health center at 302-736-2521. Please DO NOT come to the Wellness Center. Campus Nurse will perform a risk assessment, and the Wellness Center personal will advice you on what further steps are required.
What are the symptoms and complications?
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Read about COVID-19 Symptoms.

Should I be tested for COVID-19?
If you feel sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, and have traveled to China, Italy, South Korea, Iran, or Japan, or were in close contact with someone with COVID-19 in the 14 days before you began to feel sick, seek medical care. Before you go to a doctor’s office or emergency room, call ahead and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.

What Prevention Measure Should I Take?

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
If soap and water are not available, carry a hand sanitizer that is alcohol-based with at least 60% alcohol.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
Don’t share food, beverages or smoking devices with others.
Stay home if you are sick.
Avoid close contact with sick people.
While sick, limit contact with others as much as possible.
Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue or inside of your elbow when you cough or sneeze. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Germs spread this way.
Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with germs.
If you experience symptoms of respiratory illness, call the Wellness Center at 302-736-2521.
