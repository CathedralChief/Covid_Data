Caltech's first priority is the health and safety of its students, faculty, staff, and community. In consultation and accordance with local public health authorities, Caltech has resumed limited on-campus activities that directly support the research enterprise and the well-being of the community. However, new Protocols for Institutes of Higher Education issued by Los Angeles County in light of the COVID-19 pandemic preclude in-person instruction and on-campus dormitory living for the fall term.

Caltech employees who can work remotely are asked to continue to do so. On-campus events and gatherings, with the exception of those related to constitutionally protected freedoms, are also prohibited.

The select individuals who have been asked to return are required to do the following:

Practice physical distancing;
Follow one-way signage that guides traffic through campus buildings;
Wear a cloth face covering;
Perform health monitoring and reporting prior to coming, which includes taking your daily temperature; and
Use the Caltech COVID-19 Reporting application to affirm that you have been free of COVID-19 symptoms for the preceding 14 days, and to record locations visited for 15 minutes or more on campus during the course of that work day.
As of September 18, Caltech has had a total of 22 reported COVID-19 cases among the campus community. Additional information on testing, contact tracing, and reported cases can be found on the COVID-19 Cases, Testing, and Tracing page, which will be updated every weekday by 2 p.m. PDT.

Caltech will continue to work with local public health officials to monitor this situation and expeditiously contact individuals who may be at risk of exposure.

Policies and Protocols
Caltech community members should familiarize themselves with the following policies and protocols that have been adopted to mitigate transmission of COVID-19 within the community.

Policy
All members of the graduate student community whether new, returning or in residence, are
expected to abide by and participate in the Caltech Community Commitment . This policy
recognizes the risks of COVID-19, and the responsibility of each member of the Caltech community
to follow practices that protect the health and well-being of all of its members. All graduate
students who participate in instruction, research, or who live in our residences, must familiarize
themselves with the current status of our phased return to on-campus activities, and must continue
to monitor updates and changes to campus health guidelines. These can be found at Caltech's
Response to COVID-19 website. All campus policy questions should be directed to the Graduate
Studies Office.
Graduate Students
Consistent with the Community Commitment, all students are expected to comply with the
following public health and Institute guidelines:
• Graduate students must comply with all current campus protocols for the return to
research and instruction. Maintain a minimum of 6 feet (2 meters) physical distancing
from others. This includes guidelines for physical distancing, hygiene, and face coverings.
Within campus facilities, students must comply with posted directions about hygiene;
building entry and egress; movement through hallways, stairs, and elevators; and access
to classrooms, laboratories, offices, and other spaces.
• Wear face coverings inside of campus buildings and outside when it is difficult to
maintain a minimum of 6-ft physical distancing. It is strongly recommended that
students also wear face coverings when inside of suite and apartment common spaces,
whenfeasible.
• Participate in daily health monitoring, including temperature checks, consistent with any
directives or programs established for students in residence. This may involve the use of
Kinsa thermometers and smartphone applications that enable students to easily track
symptoms and report illness. The Institute will provide tools to help students document
changes to their health and students will be required to utilize these tools. For example,
students will need to complete a daily health attestation and location log in the Caltech
COVID-19 Reporting application within access.caltech.
• Immediately report any symptoms of illness to Student WellnessServices.
• Engage in contact tracing efforts, including the provision of an accurate accounting of all
contacts with individuals on and off campus.

• Cooperate with directives to isolate and quarantine as required in the case of illness or
exposure. For example, students living in undergraduate residences will be relocated to
appropriate isolation and quarantine spaces.
• Engage in personal hygiene practices such as frequent handwashing, use of hand
sanitizer when handwashing is not possible, and covering sneezes or coughs with tissues
that are immediately discarded in a trash can. Frequently sanitize high-touch surfaces
such as bathroom fixtures, light switches, doorknobs, appliances, and other items.
• Comply with Caltech immunization requirements, including verification of seasonal flu
vaccine when it becomes available. Exemption can only be arranged under Caltech’s
Vaccine Exemption Policy.
• Student card access to campus facilities will be limited. Students are prohibited from
using their card to let anyone else into a campusfacility.
• Comply with all public health directives and associated guidelines and expectations from
the Institute.
• Students who are on a leave of absence or otherwise not currently enrolled are not
permitted to access any campus facilities for any reason, without the express permission
of the Graduate Dean.
Graduate Students Living in Caltech Residences and Caltech Owned Properties:
Student Affairs has established the following expectations for graduate students living in Caltech
residences. All students living on campus should familiarize themselves with the current Resident
Guide and Housing Policies Handbook.
• Graduate students living in Caltech housing are prohibited from receiving outside
visitors or hosting guests, including other Caltech students. Caltech Housing includes the
Catalina apartments, Marks/Braun residential community and leased properties
adjacent to campus. This is consistent with the California Department of Public Health
recently released guidelines for institutes of higher education (IHE). The State of
California guidelines limit guests, requiring campuses to restrict “building access by nonresidents, including outside guests, non-residential staff and others.” These include
parents, family members, friends, research group members, and significant others; they
are not permitted to be physically present in those spaces.
• Residential students should take appropriate precautions when leaving campus to
conduct business or obtain services within the local community (shopping, exercising,
and other related activities), following public health guidelines in all interactions.
• The Catalina Recreation Rooms are closed until further notice.
• Students must comply with information posted on the patio tables and grill areas of the
Catalina Recreation Rooms.
• Use of the outdoor cooking space in the Catalina apartment complexes is available for
one household at a time.
• Access to children’s play structures in Caltech Housing are off-limits.

Campus Policies on Graduate Student Gatherings and Activities
All in-person social gatherings are currently prohibited per public health orders. Compliance with
these policies will be particularly important in the coming academic year. The following new
policies will be in effect through fall term and will be revised or extended through subsequent
terms based on public health conditions.
• The Hameetman Student Center is closed except for the business on the mainlevel.
• Student clubs and organizations must operate virtually.
• Gatherings at outside tables on campus are prohibited, please read and comply with
signage.
• If the recreation spaces on campus are able to open at a later date, students must follow
all health and hygiene requirements.
• If conditions permit, ORE will organize and approve small gatherings thatare consistent
with health and Institute policies.
Food Service
Caltech Dining Services will serve the campus community in ways that are consistent with campus
policy and public health guidelines. Students must adhere to posted protocols for meals and food
consumption; these will emphasize takeaway service and include the following guidelines:
• Students entering dining facilities must wear a face covering over their mouth andnose.
• Students must use designated dining facilities and procure meals during pre-determined
times.
• All meals are to-go and group meals are prohibited.
• Outdoor dining spaces will require a 6-foot physical distancing.
• Students must follow all instructions from Dining Services staff.
Policy Enforcement
The health and safety of the Caltech community depends on the actions of each individual member,
and students whose actions demonstrate that they do not appreciate this cannot continue to be
members of the campus community.
The primary approach to violations of COVID-19 related campus and residential policies will be
educational. Graduate students who violate policies and guidelines in ways that put other students
and the community at risk will be encouraged to understand the current rigorous policies and
guidelines. Deliberate and reckless violations of health and hygiene policies, or repeated
carelessness with respect to such policies, will not be tolerated.
The sanction for students who deliberately or repeatedly violate these policies will be the loss of
residential status and/or access to campus facilities. The Graduate Studies Office and the Office for
Residential Experience will determine whether policy violations have occurred and the Graduate
Dean or his designee will administer sanctions.

Policy
Students who return to campus during the 2020–21 academic year agree to abide by and
participate in the Caltech Community Commitment that recognizes the risks of COVID-19, and the
responsibility of each member of the Caltech community to follow practices that protect the health
and well-being of all of its members. All students who return to campus, whether to live in
undergraduate residences or to participate in instruction, research, or other activities, must
familiarize themselves with the current status of our phased return to on-campus activities, and
continue to monitor updates and changes to campus health guidelines that can be found at Caltech's
Response to COVID-19 website. Questions about undergraduate residential or social event policies
should be directed to the Office of Residential Experience (ORE). All other campus policy questions
should be directed to the undergraduate deans.
Caltech has also devised the following rules and directives for the benefit of the Caltech community:
All Undergraduate Students
Consistent with the Community Commitment, all enrolled undergraduate students are expected to
comply with the following public health and Institute guidelines:
• Maintain a minimum of 6 feet (2 meters) physical distancing from others.
• Wear face coverings inside of campus buildings and outside when it is difficult to maintain a
minimum of 6-ft physical distancing. It is strongly recommended that students also wear
face coverings when inside of suite and apartment common spaces, when feasible.
• Participate in daily health monitoring, including temperature checks, consistent with any
directives or programs established for students in residence. This may involve the use of
Kinsa thermometers and smartphone applications that enable students to easily track
symptoms and report illness. The Institute will provide tools to help students document
changes to their health and students will be required to utilize these tools. For example,
students will need to complete a daily health attestation and location log in the Caltech
COVID-19 Reporting application within access.caltech.
• Immediately report any symptoms of illness to Student Wellness Services.
• Engage in contact tracing efforts, including the provision of an accurate accounting of all
contacts with individuals on and off campus.
• Cooperate with directives to isolate and quarantine as required in the case of illness or
exposure. For example, students living in undergraduate residences will be relocated to
appropriate isolation and quarantine spaces.
• Engage in personal hygiene practices such as frequent handwashing, use of hand sanitizer
when handwashing is not possible, and covering sneezes or coughs with tissues that are
immediately discarded in a trash can.
Student Affairs Undergraduate Health
and Hygiene Policy for the 2020-21 AY Page 2 of 4 July 2020
• Frequently sanitize high-touch surfaces such as bathroom fixtures, light switches, door
knobs, appliances, and other items.
• Comply with Caltech immunization requirements, including verification of seasonal flu
vaccine when it becomes available. Exemption can only be arranged under Caltech’s Vaccine
Exemption Policy.
• Student card access to campus facilities will be limited. Students are prohibited from using
their card to let anyone else into a campus facility.
• Students may only participate in study sessions or collaborative work if (a) public health
orders allow for this; (b) study sessions and collaborative work are conducted with physical
distancing, face coverings, and appropriate hygiene practices; and (c) if such sessions or
collaborative work is held outside of residential facilities. Students who are members of the
same designated student affairs cohort are exempted from this restriction.
• Comply with all public health directives and associated guidelines and expectations from
the Institute.
In accessing campus facilities other than their residences, students must comply with all current
campus protocols for the return to research and instruction. This includes guidelines for physical
distancing, hygiene, and face coverings. Within campus facilities, students must comply with posted
directions about hygiene; building entry and egress; movement through hallways, stairs, and
elevators; and access to classrooms, laboratories, offices, and other spaces.
Students who are on a leave of absence or otherwise not currently enrolled are not permitted to
access any campus facilities for any reason, without the express permission of the undergraduate
deans.
Students Living in Caltech Residences:
Since congregate living spaces pose particular risks, Student Affairs has established the following
expectations for undergraduate students living in Caltech residences.
• Only students living on campus will be permitted in campus residential facilities.
• Residential students are prohibited from receiving outside visitors, including other Caltech
students who are not living on campus.
• Students are only permitted to enter the residence to which they are assigned. Students
with residential card access are prohibited from using their card to let anyone else into
their residence.
• The ORE will develop student cohorts or households within the residences and will create
policies for interactions within and among rooms, suites, and alleys. All residential students
must adhere to this guidance.
• Residential kitchens will be closed for the fall term. Kitchen closures will be evaluated in
subsequent terms based on current public health conditions.
• Access to residential common areas, including lounges, will be by reservation only. Students
accessing these spaces will be expected to use them in a manner that is consistent with
current cohort and physical distancing guidelines, and to follow posted cleaning procedures
before and after use. 
Student Affairs Undergraduate Health
and Hygiene Policy for the 2020-21 AY Page 3 of 4 July 2020
• Once on campus and in residence, students are expected to stay in the local Pasadena area
throughout the term. If a residential student has reason to leave the area, they should
contact the undergraduate deans. Any residential student who needs to leave the area
during a term will be expected to remain away from campus for the remainder of that term
and complete their coursework through online instruction.
• Residential students should take appropriate precautions when leaving campus to conduct
business or obtain services within the local community (shopping, exercising, and other
related activities), following public health guidelines in all interactions. Residential students
who attend social events off campus that are not conducted in accordance with physical
distancing and public health guidelines will be expected to leave campus for the remainder
of the term.
Students Residing in the Pasadena Area
Undergraduate students who have arranged to live near campus are permitted to access campus
facilities for authorized activities in ways that, at all times, respect the health and safety of the
entire community. The following guidelines must be followed:
• In accessing campus facilities, students must comply with all current campus protocols for
the return to research and instruction.
• While on campus, students are required to follow current public health and Caltech
directives for physical distancing, hygiene, and face coverings.
• Students who reside off campus are prohibited from entering the campus undergraduate
residences.
• Students who reside off campus must take public health guidelines seriously in their
interactions with residential students. Hosting off-campus social gatherings that involve
non-household members poses unacceptable risks for all members of the campus
community. If public health orders eventually allow social gatherings involving nonhousehold members, students who host social events off campus must conduct them in
accordance with physical distancing and public health guidelines. Reports of irresponsible
student hosts will be referred to the undergraduate deans for potential disciplinary action.
Campus Policies on Student Gatherings and Activities
All students living on campus should familiarize themselves with the current Resident Guide and
Housing Policies Handbook. Compliance with these policies will be particularly important in the
coming academic year. The following new policies will be in effect through fall term, and will be
revised or extended through subsequent terms based on public health conditions:
• All in-person social gatherings are currently prohibited per public health orders. If
conditions permit, ORE will organize small social events that are consistent with public
health guidelines and Institute policies.
• Alcohol consumption in group or social residential settings is prohibited.
Many residential student programs will continue online for fall term and this approach will be
evaluated in subsequent terms. 
Student Affairs Undergraduate Health
and Hygiene Policy for the 2020-21 AY Page 4 of 4 July 2020
Food Service
Caltech Dining Services will serve residential students and the campus community in ways that are
consistent with campus policy and public health guidelines. Students must adhere to posted
protocols for meals and food consumption; these will emphasize takeaway service and include the
following guidelines:
• Students entering dining facilities must wear a face covering over their mouth and nose.
• Students must use designated dining facilities and procure meals during pre-determined
times.
• Group meals are prohibited in residential facilities.
• Outdoor dining spaces will require a 6-foot physical distancing.
• Students must follow all instructions from Dining Services staff.
Policy Enforcement
The primary approach to violations of COVID-19 related campus and residential policies will be
educational. Students who carelessly or mistakenly violate policies and guidelines in ways that put
other students and the community at risk will be encouraged to understand more fully the
importance of the current rigorous policies and guidelines.
However, deliberate and reckless violations of health and hygiene policies, or repeated carelessness
with respect to such policies, will not be tolerated. The health and safety of the Caltech community
depends on the actions of each individual member, and students whose actions demonstrate that
they do not appreciate this cannot continue to be members of the campus community. The sanction
for students living on campus who deliberately or repeatedly violate these policies will be the loss
of residential status and access to campus facilities; students living off campus will lose access to
campus facilities. These students will be expected to continue their education online in subsequent
terms of the 2020–21 academic year. The undergraduate deans’ office will determine whether
policy violations have occurred and administer sanctions.
