What is the status of classes and instruction?
Fall 2020 update: In response to guidelines issued by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, UCLA will be moving to remote-only instruction for the fall, with the exception of a handful of in-person or hybrid courses that provide training for students preparing for essential workforce jobs and which cannot be conducted remotely. These include certain advanced, required classes in health and medicine, emergency services, social work, the sciences and engineering. Read the full message.
Schools and academic departments will provide a wide range of remote courses to ensure that all students have access to the classes they need to make progress toward their academic degrees.
Class locations on student study lists and the schedule of classes will be updated by the end of August.
Is student housing available for 2020–21?
Fall 2020 update: On August 3, UCLA announced fall-term plans that included the return of about 5,000 students to campus residence halls. However, in response to new guidelines issued by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, we have had to greatly reduce the number of students that can be accommodated on campus. Read the full message.
On-campus housing will now be limited to: (1) Students who have no alternative housing options and whose current housing does not provide a safe and appropriate environment or does not provide sufficient accommodations under the Americans With Disabilities Act; (2) student-athletes participating in on-campus training and conditioning; and (3) students enrolled in the small handful of in-person or hybrid courses being offered who do not have alternative local housing options.
Students with current housing contracts will be receiving letters from Housing staff to assess whether they fall into any of the above categories; those who do not will be notified of the cancellation of their contract and receive a refund of fees paid.
More information is available on UCLA Housing’s COVID-19 information page.
Residence hall occupancy is limited to one student per bedroom, and undergraduate apartments are limited to two students per bedroom.
Certain buildings will be set aside for isolation of students who test positive for COVID-19 or who were in close contact with someone who tested positive and are required to quarantine.
Students whose contracts have been canceled or who are considering changing their housing status are encouraged to read the Financial Aid and Scholarship office’s Changes to Your Housing Selection FAQ (PDF) for information on how these decisions may affect their financial aid.
UCLA does not anticipate canceling any eligible graduate students’ 2020–21 housing contracts and rental agreements in response to the pandemic.
Housing rates can be found here. 
To help students renting off-campus accommodations, UCLA Student Legal Services has provided resources on its website for students looking to start or terminate a lease. Legal Services has waived all fees for their assistance.
The Undergraduate Students Association Council has released an off-campus housing guide (PDF) to help first-time renters find housing in the Westwood area.
Health and safety precautions for fall 2020
Required asymptomatic COVID-19 testing: Testing is required for all students living in university housing or participating in on-site or hybrid classes, as well as for faculty, staff, or teaching assistants involved in teaching on site. Tests will be provided at no cost, and contact tracing protocols will be in place when anyone tests positive. Detailed information on required testing is available on our Prevention, Testing and Treatment page.
For those who will be on campus in fall, protocols and procedures are in place to help reduce the spread of the virus. Infection control measures include physical distancing, de-densifying campus spaces, and frequent cleaning of residence halls and other facilities.
Cloth face coverings are required indoors and outdoors for anyone on campus, per guidelines from local and state health authorities.
Daily symptom checks are required for anyone coming to campus or living in on-campus housing. More information on the campus’s symptom monitoring protocol is available online for students (PDF); staff and faculty performing non-healthcare work on campus (PDF); third-party contract workers (PDF); and essential visitors (PDF).
As part of the Bruin Public Health Campus Ambassadors program, ambassadors will regularly be stationed at key points throughout the campus to provide information and guidance and to ensure that UCLA’s health and safety protocols are being followed.
For further details on UCLA’s public health and safety protocols, please see the COVID-19 Public Health Mitigation Requirements page (PDF).
UCLA’s first focus this fall is on education and the development of a collaborative community of compliance to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. While we hope all members or our campus community will assist in these efforts, necessary procedures will be in place (PDF) for enforcing compliance if individuals refuse to abide by the public health mitigation measures issued by campus.
Currently, what should I do before coming onto campus?
Currently, all UCLA students who come to campus for any purpose, including class, work or other activities, are required to take a survey each day to monitor themselves for symptoms of the coronavirus. Students living in university-owned housing are also required to complete the symptom monitoring daily.
The survey may be completed on a smartphone, tablet or computer, and it should take no more than five minutes.
Students will be required to receive a clearance certificate from the survey before entering the UCLA campus grounds or any UCLA facilities — except for their own campus housing residence. UCLA will keep the information about individuals’ symptoms confidential; that information will be shared only with designated campus officials who are involved in responding to the pandemic.
Upon completion of the survey, the system will either generate a clearance certificate or direct students to call the Ashe Center COVID-19 Hotline at 310-206-6217 for instructions prior to entering UCLA shared spaces.
What happens if someone tests positive?
Students and faculty tested through the Ashe Center will be notified by the center of a positive result. Isolation and contact tracing protocols will be implemented immediately.
In addition, any UCLA community member who develops symptoms or receives a positive test result for COVID-19 is obligated to self-isolate and to contact the the Ashe Center COVID-19 Hotline at 310-206-6217 (for students) or the UCLA Infectious Disease Hotline at 310-267-3300 (for faculty, staff and volunteers).
If a student, staff or faculty member is confirmed to have COVID-19, medical professionals at UCLA or the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health will investigate to determine who is considered to have been in “close contact” with that person, contact them and ask them to self-isolate and schedule a test, if appropriate. Relevant deans, vice provosts, vice chancellors, directors and department chairs will be notified of any positive case within their areas of responsibility.
For detailed information, see UCLA’s standard notification procedures page (PDF).
Will tuition be affected because of remote instruction?
UCLA will be offering remote-only instruction for the fall, with the exception of a small handful of in-person or hybrid courses necessary to train students for essential workforce positions. Remote instruction may continue further into the 2020–21 academic year for the safety of students and the campus community. Tuition and mandatory fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded if instruction occurs remotely for any part of the 2020–21 academic year.
Full tuition and mandatory fees are necessary to cover operations related to COVID-19, such as remote instruction, and services such as financial aid, registration and remote academic advising.
For more information on tuition and fees, as well as registration, financial aid, course materials and other topics, visit the UCLA Registrar’s Office COVID-19 FAQ page. The UCLA Undergraduate Admission site also has a section on student fees, tuition and budget and one on the latest information on classes and tuition.
International students
Fall 2020 update: Under current rules, newly admitted international undergraduate and graduate students on F-1 visas wishing enter the U.S. for the fall 2020 term will be required to enroll in at least one in-person class. Unfortunately, because of new, tighter restrictions issued by county health officials and UCLA’s move to almost totally remote instruction, most of these students will not meet the legal criteria for travel to the U.S. nor have the ability to lawfully remain in the country. Read the full message.
For the reasons above, we are recommending that unless newly admitted international students are required by their major or field of study to enroll in one of the small handful of advanced on-campus courses that must be offered in person, they should stay in their home countries and study remotely.
Newly admitted and continuing students will be able to enroll in 100% remote fall classes in their home country and make normal progress toward their UCLA degree without F-1 status.
The UCLA Dashew Center for International Students and Scholars will be reaching out to newly admitted international students to offer further guidance on travel, visas and enrollment.
The center’s COVID-19 updates page, messages page and F-1 students FAQ page also provide updates and information.
Student and Exchange Visitor Information System transfer-in students from other universities and colleges who have not left the U.S. since March 9 will be exempt from the in-person class requirement.
Continuing F-1 students at UCLA will be allowed to enroll in 100% remote classes while maintaining their non-immigrant student status inside or outside the U.S.
UCLA is currently prohibited from providing remote instruction to graduate students living in countries or regions subject to federal government sanctions, including Iran, Syria, Cuba, North Korea and Crimea. This includes U.S. citizens, U.S. permanent residents and U.S. dual citizens. UCLA is also prohibited from providing remote instruction to graduate students who are from these countries unless they will be physically located in the U.S. or unless they ordinarily reside and will be physically located in a non-sanctioned state during their instruction. Students with questions about how these policies may affect them are encouraged to contact their school or departmental representative.
When will the campus completely reopen?
UCLA officials are closely monitoring the situation and relevant communications from county, state and federal authorities. They will continue to provide information on any new developments that would impact the campus and take action to ensure the health and safety of the Bruin community.
What is the status of intercollegiate athletics?
The Pac-12 Conference announced Aug. 11 that as a result of the threat of COVID-19, all sports competitions will be postponed through the end of the 2020 calendar year. The conference will examine the possibility of a return to play in the new year.
Members of UCLA’s athletics teams will remain enrolled in classes, will retain allotted scholarship funding, and will continue to have access to practice facilities and support services.

Financial aid and scholarships
The financial aid office is available virtually Monday through Friday, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., through the Message Center or by calling 310-206-0400.
The federal government has made emergency financial aid grants available to students for expenses related to the disruption of campus operations. UCLA prioritized providing awards to eligible students enrolled in spring term 2020. The campus will continue to monitor federal and state economic conditions, as well as the prospects for additional government emergency funding for students.
