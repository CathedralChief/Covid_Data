Screening measures

    Our staff screens patients over the phone for symptoms such as cough, fever and shortness of breath prior to scheduled appointments.
    Everyone who enters MU Health Care facilities, including employees, has a temperature check and is screened for COVID-19 symptoms.
    Any employee who has symptoms of a respiratory illness or a high temperature is required to stay home until recovered.

Testing for COVID-19

    Patients with scheduled procedures that require sedation, including surgeries, are tested for COVID-19 prior to their procedure.
    The test can be done at the MU Health Care drive-thru testing site or at a facility near the patient's home, if available.
    If a patient tests positive and if surgery can be safely delayed, we will postpone it until a later date.

Masking

    All staff in clinical areas are required to wear a mask and maintain physical distancing when possible.
    All patients and visitors are required to wear a mask, and you are encouraged to bring with one with you. If you do not have a mask, a staff member will provide one for you.

Waiting room changes

    We have rearranged waiting rooms and clinic spaces to better allow for physical distancing.
    We have installed Plexiglass in our check-in desks to add a barrier where physical distancing is impractical.
    We have an extensive disinfection process for all patient care equipment and furniture.

Limiting visitors

    We are limiting visitors to reduce the number of people in our facilities. Review our visitor policy.

Isolating COVID-19 patients

    When patients with symptoms of COVID-19 arrive at our facilities, we immediately isolate them to limit the risk of transmitting the virus to other patients.
    We have highly specialized teams caring for COVID-19 patients in dedicated areas of our hospitals.
    When patients with respiratory symptoms call for appointments, we can arrange virtual care visits to help to keep them at home. If they need to come into a clinic, we take them straight to an exam room with appropriate precautions.

We're here for you

We have made these changes to ensure you are comfortable and safe receiving care in our facilities.

Delaying care may lead to additional health complications in the future, so it’s important you continue to seek care, especially if you have a pre-existing or chronic condition. With the changes to our facilities, and our expanded telehealth options, we are prepared to meet your health care needs today and into the future.

If you have questions, call your doctor. Together, you can make a care plan and discuss the appointment option, whether virtual or in-person, that works best for you.

We are overwhelmed and touched by the community’s support and desire to help during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Other Ways to Help

Outside of donations, there are many other ways you can help support MU Health Care. Here are a few:
Send a simple 'Thank you'

The community's support during this time has been amazing, and we love hearing from you. Click the link below to leave notes, photos or videos of encouragement and support for all staff and providers at MU Health Care.

Donate Blood

To maintain social distancing guidelines, the Red Cross has had to cancel many blood drives, making it difficult to ensure an adequate supply. We encourage members of our community to keep their appointments or schedule new ones for blood, platelet and plasma donations.

The Red Cross follows the highest standards of safety and infection control, and volunteer donors are the only source of blood for those in need.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

At this time, MU Health Care has an adequate supply of N95 masks and other PPE. We will continue to closely monitor these supplies and have updated day-to-day practices to use resources efficiently to keep employees and patients safe now and into the future.

Many community members have expressed an interest in donating supplies. Items we can accept include:

    surgical/procedural masks
    isolation masks
    N95 and KN95 masks
    hand sanitizer
    Clorox wipes (2-3) placed in individual baggies for staff to wipe off their steering wheel and other high-touch items

Donations may be dropped off at 2910 LeMone Industrial Blvd. from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.

Feeding the front lines

Many members of our community have generously offered to supply meals for our hardworking front-line health care staff. Due to safety standards, we're unable to accept food from outside sources.

However, you can still help provide meals for our staff with a donation to our COVID-19 Relief Fund. When giving, enter "Feeding the Front Lines" in the box that says, "Please share with us why you are giving."
