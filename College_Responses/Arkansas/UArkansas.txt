SAFETY GUIDELINES AND REQUIREMENTS
All faculty, staff and students are receiving personal protection kits for the Fall Semester with masks, hand sanitizer, disinfecting wipes and thermometers as well as a tip sheet for staying safe and healthy.

Face Coverings
The use of appropriate cloth face coverings is important for the health and well-being of our campus community. Face coverings should cover both the nose and mouth.

The following requirements apply to all students, employees and visitors on campus. We anticipate that members of the campus community will cooperate with the Governor’s Executive Order and City of Fayetteville face covering requirements when off-campus, as well.

Indoors: Face Coverings Required in Campus Buildings
Face coverings are required at all times indoors on campus with the following limited exceptions:

A face covering may be removed in a private office or private room when no one else is present.
In residence halls, face coverings may be removed in private rooms as well as in community bathrooms for accomplishing tasks such as brushing teeth or showering.
Face coverings may be removed while dining but should be worn before eating and replaced as soon as possible after eating.
Face coverings may be removed during exercise in University Recreation-operated facilities as long as other UREC COVID-19 protocols are followed.
Face coverings may be removed for participants during sanctioned activities such as music rehearsals and performances, Razorback Athletics workouts, practices and contests unless otherwise required by the University’s athletic conference or governing body.
Outdoors: Face Coverings Required When Social Distancing Cannot Be Maintained
Face coverings are required outdoors when social distancing of six feet can’t be assured.

We expect our community to comply with the use of face coverings in all required settings. Those not complying with use of face coverings will be asked to leave and return with a face covering. The university is prepared to enforce these requirements through educational conversations and, if necessary, instituting Code of Student Life disciplinary actions for students or utilizing progressive discipline for employees.

These requirements were developed based on guidance provided by Gov. Asa Hutchinson’s executive order requiring face coverings in all public buildings where social distancing isn’t possible and similar guidance from the University of Arkansas Board of Trustees, the Arkansas Department of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the City of Fayetteville.

Social Distancing
Social distancing – staying at least 6-feet apart - reduces the spread of COVID-19. What does 6-feet look like? It’s like leaving enough room for two refrigerators or one Tusk V to stand between you and the person closest to you.

Classes are being reconfigured to allow for social distancing, with numbered seats that are at least 6-feet apart. Flexible schedules to allow for smaller class sizes and larger venues are also being put into place. Classes will be streamed and recorded on video as well, so those who may be self-isolating will have access to their classrooms and stay on track.

Clean Campus
Routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces followed by disinfection with an EPA-registered disinfectant is a best practice measure for prevention of viral respiratory illnesses and part of the University of Arkansas’ regular routine in multiple areas of campus, including housing, transit and parking, facilities management and much more.

Restrooms will be a focus area for high use/touch disinfection throughout each day. Efforts are underway to provide touchless soap dispensers in all restrooms.

Hand sanitizer stations are located in all major entrances and in large classrooms. Additional stations may be installed in other public areas as needed.

U of A transit buses are disinfected nightly, while our facilities management staff disinfects high traffic touchpoints daily – including door handles and push plates, student desktop surfaces and classroom teaching surfaces. Similar practices are used by university housing, athletics and other common areas on campus.

Except for drinking fountains with a touch-free bottle filler, all traditional drinking fountains will be disabled until further notice. Facilities Management will work towards a prioritized and equitable plan for replacing traditional drinking fountains with bottle fill stations over the next several months.

Classroom Flexibility and Modes of Instruction
A blended approach will be used for classes in the fall, with expanded schedules for in-person classes to allow for smaller class size and social distancing, as well as a shift of some classes to online format or a combination of the two. Additionally, all classes will be available on video for students who may need to social distance. Please continue to check schedules in UAConnect to be aware with each class’s location and method of delivery before the first day.

Students will be able to attend in person classes remotely if they choose to do so.  In-person classes will all be recorded and many if not most will have live-streamed (synchronous) delivery that allow real-time interaction as well.

Students who wish to change the mode of class delivery may request to do so. However, not all modes are available for all classes. To request remote delivery of in-person classes, please consult with your instructor. To request to change sections from online or remote delivery to an in-person class, please consult your advisor. You can see if another section is available through UAConnect. Not all modes are available for all classes.

Various modes of instruction may appear on your schedule. Below are definitions of frequently used terms:

Online Courses: Are intentionally designed for online delivery and have been traditionally offered through a remote or distance environment. While some synchronous interaction may be involved in an online course, the bulk of instructional content is typically delivered asynchronously.

Remote Courses: Are intended to be a temporary shift from normal in-person teaching to the distance delivery of course content. Remote courses are delivered synchronously at a scheduled time and use technology to allow instructor-student interaction and small-group active learning strategies. Students are expected to access the class at the scheduled time and participate in any scheduled activities during that scheduled time. While some content or activities may be asynchronous in remote courses, the bulk of the course will be delivered in the synchronous and interactive environment.

In-person Courses: All students are expected to attend class at a designated physical location and the instructor is present, in person, to lead learning activities for the entire class following appropriate social distancing measures. During this pandemic or during any crisis situation, to the extent possible, lectures in in-person courses at the University of Arkansas will be recorded and live-streamed and made available to students who need to attend remotely.

Hybrid Courses: Are a combination of in-person instruction and remotely delivered instruction.  While several models exist for hybrid delivery, at the University of Arkansas the intent is that all students will attend a in-person class, in a defined sub-group of the entire class, on an alternating and scheduled frequency. The remainder of the class attends remotely via synchronous and interactive technology. All interactive sessions in a hybrid course will be recorded and made available to you in Blackboard.

On-campus study rooms are available for students to use for remote classes. A searchable schedule of times and locations is available through the Registrar’s Office.

Daily Health Checks
All faculty and staff are required to do daily health checks through Workday. Those health checks will be used by HR and sent to supervisors every evening to provide a snapshot on the health of our campus.

COVID-19 TESTING, REPORTING, TRACING
AND QUARANTINE
Testing, reporting, isolation and quarantine protocols are in place for when a positive case is reported on campus to ensure that students who may have to quarantine or self-isolate will have access to food. On and off-campus students who have tested positive and are isolating will have daily health checks by phone as well as access to online and remote alternatives for their classes so they can stay on track. For details on other safety guidelines, please visit the Safety Guidelines and Requirements section

Pat Walker Health Center offers nasal swab PCR tests for active COVID-19 infections and is available to all students, faculty and staff who are exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, or who have been identified as a contact of an individual diagnosed with COVID-19. Asymptomatic testing will be conducted as supplies, test kits and capacity allow.

Testing
Pat Walker Health Center (PWHC) offers on-campus COVID-19 testing by appointment for all university students and employees five days a week.

Those who wish to be tested must call Pat Walker Health Center at 479-575-4451, option 1. A Telehealth visit with a Pat Walker Health Center provider may be recommended. No unscheduled testing is available at this time. If you are unsure if you need to be tested, please call Pat Walker Health Center to speak with a medical provider.

There are no out-of-pocket costs for students or employees getting tested for COVID-19 through Pat Walker Health Center.

Results of tests conducted by Pat Walker Health Center take generally one to two days to receive back. Your medical provider will contact you with your test results either by phone or through a secure message to your email.

If COVID-19 test results are positive, you will be given additional instructions for isolation and a representative from the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) and University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) will contact you.

Anyone tested after being identified as a close contact with a positive test result is required to quarantine for 14-days from the last contact date, regardless of test result.

Other NWA testing sites, COVID facts and resources can be found on the COVID website.

Self-Reporting a Positive COVID-19 Case
If you were tested off-campus, have received a positive test for COVID-19 and have been on campus any time this semester, you must self-report your case to U of A Emergency Management using this online self-reporting form.

If you were tested on-campus you do not need to self-report as your case information has already been provided directly to Emergency Management by the university.

Notification Process for Postive COVID-19 Cases
This flow chart details the U of A’s reporting, isolation, notification and other safety procedures for when a positive case is reported to U of A Emergency Management.

Contact Tracing
Contact tracing for all Arkansas colleges and universities will be conducted by UAMS in partnership with the Arkansas Department of Higher Education and the Arkansas Department of Health.

If you have tested positive — or been identified as a close contact — UAMS contact tracers will reach out to you via phone. You will also receive a call from ADH case investigators.

Contact tracing and isolation of people with COVID-19 and close contacts is critical to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community. It is very important to answer the call. If you do not answer, they will leave a generic message (with no private details) and ask you to call them back. The most frequent numbers contact tracers will call from are listed below, although they may call for other phone numbers as well.

ADH Case Investigators will call from:

1-833-283-2019
1-877-272-6819
1-800-803-7847
UAMS Contact Tracers will call from:

501-214-2410
501-686-5875
The information you provide is protected health information, so it is kept private. Contact tracers only reach out to those you have been in close contact with you (within six feet for at least 15-minutes) but will not share your name unless you give permission.

STUDENTS
Academic Support, Advising and Access
Colleges and schools are communicating directly to their students regarding alternative advising methods. For additional advising resources and questions about changing modes of class delivery see the section on Classroom Flexibility and Modes of instruction below and visit advising.uark.edu.

EVENTS
The University of Arkansas has developed a policy for campus events that requires a review and approval process based on public health considerations during the COVID-19 pandemic. This policy, which supplements the university's existing policy on facilities use, is intended to align with guidance issued by the state of Arkansas and the Arkansas Department of Health.

The new policy will be in effect for the duration of the COVID-19 emergency or until otherwise determined by the chancellor. The policy covers on-campus gatherings hosted by an official U of A unit, registered student organization or approved through the university's reservation process. Scheduled classes and informal small groups do not fall under this policy.

Event organizers must agree to abide by all applicable COVID-19 directives of the ADH, state of Arkansas and U of A. Failure to comply with these directives may result in suspension or termination of the event. Organizers are also required to submit a Campus Events and COVID-19 Authorization and Approval Form to their designated university officials for review and approval.

Please keep the following in mind:

Each event reviewed through this process is to be approved on a case-by-case basis, based on considerations of public health and safety.
Large gatherings are discouraged (and may not be allowed) at least through the end of the fall semester.
Approved events may be cancelled or altered if public health concerns warrant a change in conditions.
Online and virtual events are encouraged.
The Arkansas Union will operate under modified hours and adjustments will be made according to the rhythms of campus and in accordance with all university, state and health department guidance.
Approved events shall use sanitation protocols and social distancing practices.
Event sponsors (other than official UA units) must agree to hold the University harmless for any risk of harm or illness to participants that may results from the event.
Food service (if offered) will be limited to individual portions. Buffet or self-service will not be offered.
Event organizers should also keep a record of their event approval as well as a list of their event participants. A maintained list of event attendees is helpful in the event of a need for contact tracing.

The requirements for approving events differ depending on the size of the event and whether or not members of the public are invited to attend. The following policies are subject to change based on updates to any applicable policies or event guidance from the state of Arkansas or the university regarding on-campus events:

Campus Community Events Without Members of the Public

100 or fewer attendees shall require social distancing and face coverings. Requires approval of unit director or department head/chair.
More than 100 attendees shall require social distancing and face coverings. Requires approval of unit director/department head/chair, dean (or designee), and vice chancellor.
Campus Community Events With Members of the Public

100 or fewer attendees shall require social distancing and face covering. Requires approval of unit director/department head/chair, dean (or designee), and vice chancellor.
More than 100 attendees shall require social distancing and face covering. Requires approval of unit director/ department chair, dean (or designee), and vice chancellor as well as submission to and approval by the Arkansas Department of Health at least 24 hours prior to the start of the event.
TRAVEL
All non-essential university-sanctioned and coordinated out-of-state travel – both domestic and international* — is restricted until further notice.

Exceptions may be granted based on the necessity of travel and determined on a case-by-case basis through the appropriate Dean or equivalent for support units. Appeals to a Dean’s decision (or the decision of an equivalent for support units) may be made to the appropriate Vice Chancellor. Exceptions for club or organization, academic, research, or athletic travel may be granted in accordance with CDC, ADH, and NCAA guidance and other university travel office policies or state travel regulations.

Travelers seeking an appeal for domestic travel are required to submit a Domestic Travel Appeal Form to their designated university officials for review and approval. International travel must adhere to Academic Policy 1835.00. 

Travel is restricted; however, the following factors may be used when making decisions for exceptions for essential travel, including but not limited to:

Necessity of travel; there is an institutional or professional necessity for travel and lack of non-travel alternatives. 
Risk factors for travel; location of travel, risk of infection associated with travel mode and locations, community infection rates at destination, travel duration, potential for exposure at the event or activity, potential for quarantine or isolation upon arrival and return.
Planned risk mitigation; awareness of local regulations and laws to prevent infection, social distancing, appropriate face coverings, personal sanitation and hygiene, safe transportation arrangements, sanitary and safe housing arrangements, planned safe meals and entertainment, personal interaction and meetings, contact tracing following exposure to infected individuals or groups, and response to potential positive tests upon return. 
For student travel, an accompanying faculty or staff is required to ensure CDC, ADH or NCAA guidelines are being followed. 
All non-essential university-sanctioned and coordinated fall 2020 study abroad programs have been canceled. More information can be found at the Study Abroad COVID-19 website.

Currently, there are no quarantine requirements for travelers entering Arkansas from either domestic or international locations.
