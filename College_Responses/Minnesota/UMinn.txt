Welcome to fall semester 2020 at the University of Minnesota!

Our fall plans reflect our commitment throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to prioritize the health and safety of all University students, faculty, and staff. We coordinate continuously with our public health and medical professionals—at a state level and within our own University community. Most importantly, we are working to implement processes that will reduce the spread of COVID-19.

The Maroon and Gold Sunrise Plan is primarily for residence hall undergraduate students living on the Duluth, Rochester, and Twin Cities campuses. Other undergraduates will find guidance in the plan as well. Graduate and professional students are not affected by this plan and should continue their studies and schedule as previously determined for Fall 2020. Each campus is implementing local processes based on the guidance of this plan. 

The University of Minnesota Twin Cities is currently in “Step Three” of the Maroon and Gold Sunrise. 
Step One

Students will live and learn almost exclusively within residence halls for at least 10 days. Students should not visit other residence halls, businesses or residences off-campus. The time to be back in residence halls is 9 p.m.
Step Two

Students in University housing will have increased access, including visiting all on-campus locations and the surrounding community. However, students must be “back home” in their residence hall by 9 p.m.
Step Three

Students in University housing will have full access to University facilities and communities off campus as they do in Step Two, but they must be “back home” in their residence hall by midnight.
Step Four

As in the other steps, students are asked to wear masks, maintain physical distancing, and avoid large gatherings as they continue to have full access to on- and off-campus locations. Different from Step Three, there are no “back home” time constraints.


Academic Instruction

    Campus academic calendars are adjusted to conclude all in-person instruction by Wednesday, November 26, the day before Thanksgiving. Spring break on the Twin Cities campus will be April 5-9, 2021.
    Tuition and fees will remain the same, regardless of the method of instruction. 
    Each department planned for the return of the in-person instruction option, which include signage, reduced classroom density, and spaced furniture placement—all to maintain physical distancing. For specific information on the safety precautions that will be implemented in your learning spaces, visit the Office for Classroom Management or contact your college or department.
    Regular housekeeping practices are enhanced by University facilities management teams, including frequent cleaning and sanitization of high-touch areas such as door handles, railings, and elevator panels. Find more information about cleaning procedures, hand sanitizer availability, and other guidance by visiting Facilities Management’s site.
    Wear a face covering inside University buildings and outdoors where maintaining physical distancing of six feet is difficult. 
    Learn more about MTest, the University’s plans for COVID-19 testing and contact tracing and the role we all play in keeping one another safe and healthy.
    The Disability Resource Center remains available to identify reasonable accommodations.
    Once the campus returns to offering the option to participate in in-person instruction while practicing physical distancing and other health habits, please understand this is an individual decision. 
    If you are unable to participate in your coursework due to illness, contact your instructor immediately via email or phone. If verification is requested, please see the Makeup Work for Legitimate Absences Policy.

Campus Experience

    During the phased approach outlined in the Maroon and Gold Sunrise, Students have increased access to campus facilities and the greater community with doors monitored after midnight.
    The Gophers Protecting Gophers campaign encourages the University community to wear face coverings, practice social distancing, and implement other behaviors that slow the spread of COVID-19. 
    University buildings require a U Card or other secure means of access.
    Campus services, such as academic advising, career services, etc., will be available in a modified way on the Twin Cities campus.

On-Campus Housing

The Maroon and Gold Sunrise Plan for undergraduate students in residence halls provides steps to allow for students to gradually become involved in on-campus life. These steps include limitations designed to reduce COVID-19 transmission. 

    For students living on-campus, Housing & Residential Life has taken the following steps: 
        Rooms have been measured to ensure there is enough space to maintain the recommended six feet of physical distance while occupying your room at the same time as your roommate.
        Students should review updated policies on the Community Behavioral Standards web page for more information on health, safety, guests, and maximum occupancy.
    Students who may be at greater risk due to health complications can request housing accommodations to reduce their risk. 
    Housing & Residential Life partners closely with local and state public health officials to address cases of COVID-19 that arise in residential communities. Rooms for isolation and quarantine will be set aside for students with a housing contract who are ill with possible COVID-19 or who have tested positive for COVID-19. Review the MTest Protocols and response to learn more.

For students living in off-campus housing not owned by the University, please view these steps to take if exposed to COVID-19 or receive a confirmed positive test and visit the Office for Off-Campus Living for resources and support.
