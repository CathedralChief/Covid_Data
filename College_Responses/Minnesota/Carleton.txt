Compounding the COVID-19 pandemic with an influenza outbreak on Carleton’s campus could place the community’s health and safety at risk, decrease the likelihood that the 2021 academic year is completed in-person, and stress local medical resources. As an additional measure to help keep our community safe, all students and employees who are living, working or learning on campus are required to receive a seasonal flu vaccine by Oct. 1, 2020. We held on-campus vaccination clinics during the month of September.

Students can work with Disability Services to request a medical accommodation or Associate Dean of Students Joe Baggot to request a religious accommodation regarding the seasonal influenza vaccination requirement.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) recommend that everyone over the age of 6 months receive a seasonal flu vaccine every year.

The Covenant requires that students follow Minnesota Department of Health guidelines, which restrict indoor social gatherings to 10 or fewer people, and outdoor social gatherings to 25 or fewer people. You must wear a mask and maintain at least a 6-foot distance from others when indoors and around those with whom you do not share a living space. Residential Life has communicated additional guidelines (e.g., having fewer than 10 people in your room) directly to students. The college will investigate and issue sanctions according to the Covenant Sanction Guidelines to individuals who do not follow these protocols. 

Page 1 of 3•Comply with testing.  I will participate in COVID-19 testing as required by the college.•Perform symptom screening.  I will complete daily symptom screenings as required by the college.•If I discover that I have symptoms of COVID-19, I will immediately remove myself from common areas, self-isolate, and ensure that my new symptoms have been documented in the daily symptom screening system.  If I am a student, I will contact Student Health and Counseling.  If I am an employee, I will contact my medical provider as necessary.Required Testing and Symptom ScreeningGeneral Commitments•Act with respect.  I will strive to approach this document and my behavior with kindness, patience, care, and respect for each other. •Give and receive reminders.  Each of us may need a friendly reminder from time to time if we forget or stray from the new requirements on campus.  I commit to do my best to give and receive these reminders with goodwill and cooperation.  When I feel that it is necessary, I will complete a Community Concern Form to let others know about my concern.•Adhere to this covenant.  I understand that participation in campus life is a privilege, and that the college will enforce this covenant in a manner consistent with our overall campus culture and educational philosophies.  If I am unable to meet these commitments to my fellow community members, I will remove myself from campus.  Repeated, willful, or serious infractions will result in corrective action or discipline; the college may prohibit me from participating in any in-person campus activities, including but not limited to residency and employment.Specifically, I commit to all of the following:A covenant is first and foremost an agreement based on respect.  As members of the Carleton community, it is our collective responsibility to ourselves and to others to hold to these standards, expectations, and norms.  As we navigate this academic year, respect must be kept at the forefront of our minds and guide all of our behavior.  This document outlines some ways in which respect is expected to be demonstrated, but does not encompass all the ways we, as Carleton community members, can demonstrate respect.  The three central aspects of respect are: respect for self, respect for others, and respect for spaces.  It is essential that we hold ourselves and others accountable, as well as taking care of the spaces we occupy and share.I agree to the Carleton Community Covenant and will follow these directives to do my part to help protect the health and safety of the entire Carleton community, for the sake of myself and others.  I recognize that my actions and decisions affect the health and well-being of us all and that the only way Carleton can maintain the residential learning experience at this time is through the shared commitment and cooperation of the entire community.  I further understand that my ability to live, learn, and work at Carleton is conditional on my adherence to the following policies.Introduction and PrinciplesCarleton Community Covenant
Page 2 of 3Close Contacts, Visitors, and Gatherings•Minimize close contacts.  I will strive to keep as small as possible the number of people with whom I have close contact (roommates, housemates, coworkers in shared workspaces; anyone I have spent 15+ minutes within six feet [even if masked]; anyone who has come into direct contact with my respiratory fluids through coughing, sneezing, kissing, etc.).•Do not have visitors from off campus in any campus building.  I will not enable any guest from outside the Carleton campus community (those authorized to work or take classes on campus this term) to enter any campus building.  I understand that I may visit with off-campus guests in outdoor spaces, with appropriate precautions.Physical Distancing and Face Masks•Maintain physical distance.  I will strive to maintain a minimum of six feet between me and any other person according to physical distancing protocol, except my roommates or housemates.  •Wear a face mask.  Except when impossible (eating, tooth brushing, etc.), I will wear a clean face mask in all indoor spaces unless I am in my room/house or alone in my office.  I will also wear a face mask outdoors when it is difficult to maintain a six-foot distance from others.•Leave furniture where it is.  I will not rearrange furniture in shared workspaces and common spaces, including dining halls and classrooms.  I will not rearrange beds in the shared sleeping space of my campus residence.General Preventative Health•Maintain personal hygiene.  I will practice good personal hygiene.  I will thoroughly and frequently clean my hands (for 20+ seconds with soap and water, or by using hand sanitizer) especially after returning from outside, after using a restroom, and before and after meals.•Maintain cleanliness of spaces.  I will keep common spaces clean and disinfected, including bathrooms, study spaces, lounges, and classrooms.  To protect the health of others, including the custodial staff, I will dispose of my potential contaminants (such as used tissues or masks) myself.•Get vaccinated against the flu.  Unless I have a documented medical or religious reason not to be vaccinated, I will get a flu vaccine when it becomes available at Carleton.Isolation, Quarantine, and Contact Tracing•If I test positive for or am diagnosed with COVID-19, I will share full and accurate information with contact tracers, including the names of all of my close contacts.  I will also fully comply with self-isolation requirements. •If I am found to have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19,I will fully comply with self-quarantine requirements.  •Report off-campus notifications.  If I receive a diagnosis, positive test, or instructions to self-quarantine from a non-Carleton source, I will report it to Carleton: •If I am a student, I will complete a Community Concern Form. •If I am a staff or faculty member, I will complete the COVID-19 reporting form on the HR website.
Page 3 of 3•Respect the boundaries of those with whom I share spaces.  Before I invite another member of the campus community into a space that I share with others, I will ensure that everyone with whom I share that space has agreed to that visit.•Keep social gatherings small, distanced, and masked.  I will follow protocols for social gatherings, whether indoors or outdoors.  I will neither host nor participate in any gathering that exceeds size limitations, nor in any gathering that does not adhere to distancing and masking requirements.Travel and Off-Campus Behavior•Avoid travel when possible, and follow guidelines.  I will avoid unnecessary travel.  If travel is necessary, I will follow any pre- or post-travel guidelines (such as reporting, self-quarantining, a testing regimen, or potentially losing access to campus) designated by Carleton or the state of Minnesota. •Maintain distancing and masking off campus.  I will seek to limit my off-campus excursions, and I will maintain the same physical distancing and masking behaviors off campus as I do on campus.•Follow federal, state, and local policies.  To respect the health and safety of the Northfield community, I will follow protocols to limit exposure established by the federal government, the state of Minnesota, Rice County, the city of Northfield, and Carleton College.Acknowledgement of ExpectationsI pledge to respect myself by monitoring for the symptoms of COVID-19 and practicing good hygiene habits.I pledge to respect others by maintaining appropriate physical distance, wearing a face mask, staying home if I feel ill or if I’ve been exposed to someone who is ill or tested positive for COVID-19, and doing all I can to be considerate of others.I pledge to respect Carleton’s residential experience by adhering to expectations for testing, contact tracing, isolation and/or quarantine, and social behavior.  I will observe campus signage and communication regarding COVID-19 instructions and follow directives.  I will take responsibility for speaking up if I am aware of others who choose to act in violation of this covenant.As a member of the Carleton College community, I commit to abide by the directives of the Carleton Community Covenant to keep myself and others as healthy as possible, and keep the Carleton community vibrant.



You are expected to avoid unnecessary travel. In order to ensure the safety of the community, we require any student who needs to complete an overnight visit off campus to notify us of their travel prior to departure and, upon return, to self-monitor and take an on-campus COVID-19 test at their own expense ($150). “Self-monitoring” means you will have a designated space to live for 10 days, take all meals grab and go, and not be able to attend face-to-face classes or use public spaces, among other restrictions. These updated guidelines are necessary to ensure the health and safety of the entire community, particularly as transmission rates are rising here in Minnesota and across the country.   

If you have plans for overnight travel, please complete the COVID19 Overnight Visit form.
