A face covering is an item that covers the nose and mouth, including cloth masks, scarves, bandanas or buffs or medical-grade masks. All faculty, staff, students and visitors across all U of I locations must use face coverings whenever in any U of I building, unless one of the following exceptions is met:

When working alone in an enclosed workspace;
In an office where 6 feet social distancing can be constantly maintained
When exercising in a fitness facility, so long as the facility’s safety protocols are otherwise followed;
When eating in a dining facility, so long as the facility’s safety protocols are otherwise followed; and
Where space can be designed to provide for adequate barriers or consistent social distancing.
Face coverings are required on campus in outdoor settings where 6 feet of physical distancing cannot be maintained.
How do I address someone not following guidelines?
There may be times that you need to confront members of our community who are not adhering to the Healthy Vandal Pledge. Here is a simple rubric to follow on confronting this behavior.

Step 1. Ask the person to follow the expectations outlined the Healthy Vandals Pledge and request the person correct their behavior in a polite and respectful manner.

Here are some examples of ways to address the behavior:

The university requires that all individuals on campus maintain appropriate social distancing, especially in classroom settings or in the presence of members of our community who are more susceptible to COVID-19. I need you to please practice proper social distancing to keep our community safe.
There is a requirement that all community members wear a face covering appropriately to keep us all safe and healthy. I need you to please wear your wear a face covering before continuing to be in this space.
I am asking you to do this to keep you and our community safe. Will you please wear you face covering?
I understand that you do not want to miss this class/event/meeting, but for the safety of our community, I cannot let you continue attending this class/event/meeting until you follow the appropriate expectations. How can I help you attend this class/event/meeting safely?
Can you please wear your face covering and/or maintain appropriate social distancing? All of us need to follow the expectations so we can remain on campus and not have to move to remote instruction. Will you please help keep our community safe and contribute to us being able to stay on campus?
Step 2. Inform the person of the importance of following the expectations in the Healthy Vandals Pledge.

Share resources regarding the safe practices.

Where can they get face coverings? All students should have received a face covering. If you need a single use face covering, contact covid19questions@uidaho.edu.
Where can I pursue accommodations if I have a medical reason to not wear a face covering? CDAR for student accommodations or HR for employee accommodations.
Step 3. When to report.

The health of our community includes healthy confrontation. Issues of non-compliance don’t always have to be reported. Accountability and corrective action are everyone’s responsibility and most of the situations will be resolved amicably. But sometimes we reach a point when reporting the behavior is the best action.

Here are some situations where reporting is appropriate:

The person has been reminded several times either within a class period or over many days.
The person has actively refused to comply with the request and responds disrespectfully.
The person has caused disruption in the educational or work environment.
When you get to this point of reporting, here are somethings to include and keep in mind:

If possible, follow up with the person privately (either in person or via email) to further determine if there is an issue with using face coverings and first try to resolve it through conversation.
It is important to let the person you are addressing know that the behavior in question will be reported either at the point of the conversation or as a follow up email.
It will be most helpful to have the name of the person you are reporting.
You are able to report anonymously, but it is better to include your information in case there are follow up questions.
To report the incident, please file a VandalCARE report. You can report both students and employees here. Employee reports will be sent to Human Resources. Student reports will be sent to the Dean of Students.

All instructors are encouraged to work with students and be as flexible as possible. We want you to stay home if you are sick and expect the same of the instructors. Communicate with your instructor if you need to miss class because you aren’t feeling well, have been potentially exposed or have tested positive for COVID-19. If you are concerned for your health and would like assistance, file a VandalCARE report.

You are always able to enroll in any of our online programs. If you want to continue in a in-person program but do so online in the fall, work with your academic advisor to identify classes and sections that may fit these criteria.

If you are not feeling well, you should stay home. Contact a medical professional if necessary or file a VandalCARE Report for additional assistance

You will then be contacted by Idaho Public Health to help identify anyone you may have been in close contact with so contact tracing can begin. They will also discuss the isolation expectations around your diagnosis.

File a VandalCARE report with the Dean of Students Office. Someone from the office will be in contact to discuss next step. If you live in Housing and Residential Life or Greek chapter housing, you will be moved to an isolation space on campus. If you live off campus, you are expected to isolate in your residence.
