The safety of the Boise State community is our top priority. As the semester progresses, every Bronco will play a part in caring for others. Please model healthy behaviors for the well-being of everyone on campus.
FACIAL COVERINGS
Everyone is required to wear a facial covering while in Boise State buildings. Facial coverings are also required in outdoor community spaces where physical distancing of at least six feet is not possible. As indicated in the university’s policy on communicable diseases, compliant facial coverings must be:

clean, reusable or single-use disposable coverings
cover the nose and mouth
are closed at the bottom
do not allow respiratory droplets to escape though vents or other means
Please follow CDC guidance for care and use of facial coverings.

Visitors to any Boise State location are expected to adhere to established, posted guidelines. This includes observing physical distancing measures, wearing facial coverings and possibly answering health screening questions posed by the university’s public health team.

This fall, the university will offer a blend of in-person, online, remote and hybrid courses. Although not all courses will be offered through all delivery mechanisms, the university will work to keep all students on-track to achieving their academic goals.

How in-person classes have changed at Boise State
In-person classes will be held in rooms of suitable size to achieve appropriate physical distancing. If classes cannot be moved to larger meeting or conference spaces (for example, chemistry labs), other measures will be taken to achieve physical distancing (e.g., providing smaller groups of students alternating access to the space).

In addition, facial coverings must be worn by all students, staff and faculty while indoors, and outdoors when physical distancing cannot be achieved.

Students enrolled in in-person or hybrid classes must engage in daily health monitoring. Any student who shows signs or symptoms of COVID, or is required to self-quarantine or isolate after exposure, or who receives a positive test result will be excused from class for the duration of the quarantine or isolation.

Faculty will assist these students to stay current with classwork in order to allow students to return to class only when they are well.

Accommodations for hearing-impaired students
Faculty may wear face shields while lecturing, in lieu of facial coverings, to assist students with hearing impairments. In cases where faculty and students cannot maintain appropriate physical distance from one another due to the nature of the coursework, both individuals will wear both face shields (or safety glasses) and facial coverings.

Nearly all in-person classes will transition to remote learning after Thanksgiving
In an effort to facilitate travel for the Thanksgiving holiday and reduce the risk of a spike in post-Thanksgiving infections, nearly all in-person instruction will end on the last class day prior to Thanksgiving break.

Following Thanksgiving break, classes will be conducted remotely for the final two weeks of instruction; finals will also be remote, with limited exceptions.

Computer labs and Albertsons Library will remain available for student use, and university offices will continue to provide in-person and/or remote services to students after the Thanksgiving break.

Residential students are welcome to travel for the Thanksgiving and winter breaks, but may be required to quarantine upon their return depending on the location of their travel. Select clinical rotations, student teaching experiences and internships may require some students to stay in the Boise area until the end of the semester.

Students in specialized programs
Health Sciences students in clinical placements should continue to follow guidelines established by their host site, which are aligned with their respective professional organizations.

Other students in off-site internships, field study or student-teaching roles should adhere to the guidelines in this document and those of the sponsoring organization.

Kinesiology, music, band, dance and theatre students should:

Abide by recommended risk mitigation strategies, including maintaining a physical distance of at least 10 feet when singing, yelling, heavy breathing, etc.
Consider outdoor activities and continued virtual instruction where possible.
Additional screening of faculty, staff and students in these programs may be required; additional information will be provided as decisions are made.

Facilities

Numerous guidelines have been put into place to help ensure that our campus can sustain in-person classes for the fall semester and beyond.

Facility access
Access to campus buildings will be restricted to students, faculty and staff with a valid Bronco Card. Guests, contractors and vendors who have been approved to be on campus will receive instructions for accessing campus buildings from their university contacts.

Any person in possession of a valid Bronco Card can access most academic buildings between the hours of 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., Monday through Friday. All academic buildings will be open 7 a.m.-6 p.m. and can be accessed without scanning a card. Between 6-10 p.m., academic buildings can be accessed using a card reader equipped entrance. Access to all buildings from 10 p.m.-7 a.m. will be restricted to users who have been authorized to enter specific buildings after normal business hours.

On Saturdays, academic buildings can only be accessed with a Bronco Card between the hours of 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. Most buildings will be closed on Sunday, with a few exceptions including the Student Union Building (SUB), Recreation Center and Albertsons Library.

Enhanced cleaning and preventative measures
Boise State will provide the following throughout campus facilities:

Hand sanitizer, wipes and sprays in common areas, classrooms and offices so that faculty and staff can assist with disinfection of spaces throughout the day.
Signage signaling handwashing facilities and hand hygiene products.
Facial coverings and appropriate signage and training.
Assistance arranging spaces to reduce occupancy and provide physical distancing.
Physical barriers, plexiglass, floor markings or signage at high-traffic point-of-sale, service, reception or other locations where frequent in-person interaction must occur.
A full listing of considerations being made for facilities can be found on the campus operations website.

Specific facilities considerations
Person studying in the library

The following information outlines how the Albertsons Library, Children’s Center, Campus Recreation Center, and shuttles and parking aim to keep you safe this fall.

Albertsons Library
Albertsons Library will be open for the fall term, but it may limit access to members of the university community.

Additionally, the library may take one or more of the following infection mitigation steps:

Reduce capacity of certain spaces, such as study and conference rooms, in the library to achieve appropriate physical distancing.
Sanitize shared materials, computers and other equipment between use.
Reconfigure or remove furniture to achieve appropriate social distancing.
Children’s Center
The Children’s Center will follow the guidelines established by their accrediting body, codes and regulations, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and the following:

Advise staff and students in the center about the potential enhanced risk of providing care, as well as parents and guardians about the potential enhanced risk associated with receiving care.
Stagger drop-off times to avoid crowding and give staff adequate time to assess each child’s health (temperature check and brief questionnaire) before the child is checked in for the day.
Use best efforts to maintain physical distancing in classrooms by limiting the capacity of classrooms to allow children to spread out.
Encourage outdoor activities to limit children’s time in enclosed spaces.
Keep children in consistent groups, both indoors and out, with the same caregivers to minimize the possibility of cross-infection.
Stagger pick-up times and walk children out when parents or guardians arrive to pick-up.
The Children’s Center is evaluating when food service will resume. Additional information will be provided to families once it becomes available.
Recreation
Gyms, pools and the Campus Recreation Center will comply with risk reduction strategies and local health department guidelines. These strategies include:

Class sizes and equipment must be spaced to accommodate physical distancing of at least 10 feet between people and equipment.
Occupancy will be capped below capacity and will be revisited as outbreak conditions change.
Gyms, including the Recreation Center, will be cleaned and disinfected multiple times throughout the day, especially in high-touch areas.
Users will be required to clean and disinfect equipment before and after each use with provided cleaners and disinfectants.
Campus Recreation will offer virtual workout options, limited group exercise classes in the Recreation Center and outdoor exercise classes where possible for students and members.
Shuttles and Parking

Parking and Transportation Services will use its best efforts to increase shuttle services on high-use routes to ensure appropriate physical distancing is possible.

Shuttles will be disinfected frequently.
Facial coverings will be required of drivers and passengers.
Staff will attempt to disinfect parking kiosks and meters with regularity, but members of the campus community should assume that these surfaces have not been disinfected. Please wash or sanitize your hands promptly after use.

Students will be encouraged to build community with roommates and others in the residence hall. In-person events and social activities will be planned with special consideration to time, space and density within residential communities.

Housing will establish new guidelines for external guests visiting housing units.

University Sponsored Travel
University sponsored travel for employees, students and visitors is suspended through the end of the calendar year subject to the following exceptions:

Field-work, where COVID precautions are integrated into the principal investigator’s research restart plan and approved by the VP for Research and Economic Development in consultation with the university’s public health officer.
Athletic and academic team travel, when travel plans are pre-approved by the university’s public health officer.
Other essential travel approved by the appropriate divisional VP and in consultation with the university’s public health officer.
Requests for exceptions will be approved only if the work or event is time-sensitive, essential to fulfilling the mission of the university and cannot be conducted remotely.

In all cases, individuals returning to campus from approved travel, or visitors being invited to campus, may, at the discretion of the university’s public health officer, be required to self-quarantine in the local area before entering university owned or controlled spaces.

Personal Travel
Personal travel to high prevalence areas of COVID is discouraged. Employees or students who travel for personal reasons must review the guidelines below or consult with the university’s public health office to determine if self-quarantine is required upon return. Email publichealth@boisestate.edu or call (208) 426-2968 for more information.

Personal travel decision tree

Select dining services across campus will be open to accommodate the university’s hungry thinkers – you can visit the dining services website for more details on specific hours of operation.

For on-campus dining and retail outlets that are open, the university may adjust food service in one or more of the following ways:

Offer only to-go food service.
Reduce the capacity of on-site dining areas and prioritize outdoor dining areas.
Restrict self-service of food and/or beverages (buffets, salad bars, drink stations, condiment stations, etc.) to mitigate virus transmission through high-touch surfaces, condiments and food.
Limit the number of customers in dining areas at any one time to ensure appropriate physical distancing can be achieved.
Extend food service hours throughout the day to reduce line crowding at mealtimes.
Eliminate reusable kitchen items and replace with single-use options. Replace shared appliances with single-use or no-touch options.
Suspend or limit catering and concessions.
Enhanced cleaning protocols for dining services
Dining services staff will clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (door handles, workstations, cash registers) along with shared objects (payment terminals, tables, countertops/bars, receipt trays, condiment holders) at opening, closing and between meals.

In addition, touchless payment options will be used as often as possible and patrons will be encouraged to use preorder and prepayment options whenever possible.

Finally, physical barriers, such as sneeze guards and partitions, will be used at cash registers and other food pick up areas.

How and when athletic competitions will resume is yet to be determined. Boise State officials will work with the NCAA, the Mountain West Conference and health experts to make these decisions when we can.

Boise State is proud that campus is one of the best and best-used meeting spots in Idaho. But our highest priority is always students — and we will need as much space as we can for classrooms that can accommodate the physical distancing needed to keep students safe. Even ExtraMile Arena will house classes this fall.

All events for outside groups in all venues have been canceled through Sept. 4.
All university and student events will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis as safety measures, room and staff availability, and other factors are taken into account.
Athletics
University guidelines will generally apply to student athletes in the same manner as all other students. Additionally:

Because athletics presents challenges with physical distancing and minimization of groups, particularly with contact sports, special considerations will be made to protect the student-athletes, coaches, athletic trainers and strength staff.
Student athletes and athletic staff will undergo routine symptom screening on a periodic basis based on the advice of public health and university medical staff.
Decisions about holding particular athletic activities (organized and informal) and events will be made on a case-by-case basis with guidance from the NCAA, the Mountain West Conference and the advice of public health and university medical staff. These decisions will take into consideration the degree to which the risk can be mitigated and must comply with federal, state and local guidelines.
Further guidance is forthcoming and will be published when available.
Club and Intramural Sports
The university recognizes the importance of club and intramural sports to the physical and mental health and wellbeing of our campus community. However, these programs often carry many of the enhanced COVID-19 risks that exist in varsity athletic programs.

The university’s public health officer and medical advisors will work with representatives from club and intramural sports to determine whether and how they can continue their activities this fall.
