Johns Hopkins University:

Following a fall semester that was conducted online-only in order to protect our campus community and neighbors in Baltimore, we are now planning for a spring semester that will offer in-person residential and educational opportunities for undergraduates while providing expanded COVID-19 testing and observing key public health strategies. 

We are outlining the parameters of our plan in early November and will offer more details when we release our Phase 2 Return to Campus Guidance in December. We will evaluate the public health conditions in Baltimore and nationally and make a determination in January, if not sooner, about whether our plans for the semester can be carried out safely or whether we will need to change course.
1. We plan to offer in-person educational opportunities for undergraduates for the spring semester.

    Courses will be offered in a mix of modalities. In-person courses will be limited in size and conducted in a physically distanced environment, and select courses will continue to be taught virtually.
    To the greatest extent possible, in-person courses will also have a remote option.
    Students who come to campus may continue to have some or all of their classes conducted remotely.
    Course modalities will be visible in SIS before registration, which begins:
        Nov. 13 for seniors
        Nov. 16 for juniors
        Nov. 18 for sophomores
        Nov. 20 for first-years
    In-person research opportunities will be available for undergraduates as part of school-approved lab plans. Remote opportunities will continue to be available.
    The semester will start Jan. 25.
     Instead of a week-long spring break, days off will be scattered throughout the semester.
    The suspension of university-sponsored undergraduate travel will continue at least through Intersession. Additionally, the outgoing undergraduate Study Abroad program has been suspended for Spring 2021.  

2. Students will not be required to come to campus.

    Students who remain remote for the spring semester will be able to maintain their academic progress.
    All Intersession courses will be offered in the virtual environment from Jan. 4 – 15, 2021. Students interested in attending the Intersession virtually can view the published schedule on SIS beginning Nov. 16; Intersession registration will open in SIS on Dec. 1.
    Virtual student services will continue to be offered to all students regardless of location. 

3. The university will provide on-campus housing and dining options for the spring semester.

    First-year students who come to campus will live in residence halls in a de-densified environment, with single bedrooms and limited sharing of bathroom facilities.
    Based on housing surveys, we are optimistic that we will be able to provide housing in residence halls for all sophomores who expressed a desire to live in JHU-secured housing, but they will also have the option to live off-campus.
    Juniors and seniors will continue to live off-campus as usual.
    Dining plans will be available, with options dependent on the public health situation at the time.
    We are setting aside a substantial number of quarantine and isolation accommodations for residential students as well as isolation accommodations for any undergraduates living off-campus who are deemed in need of them by our health and wellness team.

4. On-campus activities will continue to follow best public health practices.

    In-person student activities will remain restricted by campus guidelines governing physical distancing and limits on gathering size (currently 10 people).
    We expect a decision about spring sports will be made in December.
    We plan to open the rec center, Brody Learning Commons and Milton S. Eisenhower Library with limits on density and reduced hours.  

5. The university will significantly expand its COVID testing program.

    The university will provide mandatory twice-weekly testing for undergraduates, beginning the week of Jan. 18.
    Testing will be required at least once weekly for faculty, staff, and graduate students who are participating in or directly supporting in-person, on-campus classes (with exceptions for clinically-based instruction) or who are regularly exposed to undergraduates.
    The divisions may also designate for required testing any faculty, staff, or graduate students who are deemed to have a heightened risk of exposure.
    Voluntary testing will be available for all other affiliates in the Baltimore area.   

6. We will continue to require students, faculty, and staff to observe COVID safety measures.

    We will require comprehensive COVID safety measures on campus, including face coverings, physical distancing, limits on gatherings, enhanced cleaning protocols and self-monitoring for symptoms.
    Individuals will be required to check their symptoms using the ProDensity app every day before going to one of our campuses.
    All students must have a flu vaccine or an approved exception before returning to campus.
    Non-essential travel outside of the greater Baltimore area is strongly discouraged for undergraduates at any time. Essential or emergency travel should be registered with Student Affairs so students can receive support for appropriate self-quarantine and testing upon return to Baltimore/campus. Depending on the circumstances of travel, additional testing and quarantine may be required. 

We are currently planning for an expansion of on-campus activities for the spring semester as long as the public health situation allows it, including offering undergraduates in-person residential and educational opportunities.  Graduate and professional schools are also determining their plans for the spring and will announce them shortly. For the remainder of 2020, however, we will continue to operate in Phase 1 of our reopening plan.

During our current Phase 1, on-campus activities will be restricted to mission critical functions that cannot be performed remotely. Broadly, this means that most Johns Hopkins affiliates will not be on-campus on a full-time basis and services will continue to be offered virtually. All undergraduate and most graduate students will take their courses online or remotely.

Those who need to be present in their lab, office, or other campus location to conduct research activities can proceed after permission from a researcher’s divisional leadership. Individuals engaging in on-campus research must comply with the guidance in Research Guidelines to reduce density, maintain physical distance, and observe other health and safety measures. Most instruction will remain in an online/remote modality, and the standards and expectations for teaching will be determined by each school individually. For example, schools may ask faculty and TAs to use campus studios for remote instructional purposes—these will be sanitized and set up with measures to protect users as described in the Instructional Guidelines.

Libraries will be operational, but access will be limited. Most other campus facilities, including recreational centers, will remain closed for the fall semester.
