GATEWAYS TO REOPENING
The Governor's Reopen Connecticut Advisory Group, which included members from UConn and other state colleges and universities, set the following key conditions for reentry that the state and UConn are responsible for meeting. The current status of each is noted.

The prevalence of the disease must be low enough to safely resume operations on our campuses. For residential undergraduate programs, public health experts recommend a sustained low and non-increasing rate of new hospitalizations in the state and the community surrounding each college. Status: Complete
The State must ensure that colleges and universities have adequate supplies of viral diagnostic tests and adequate financial support to obtain, administer, and process them. Nonresidential institutions must test symptomatic students, faculty, and staff; residential institutions must also test students upon arrival and at appropriate intervals thereafter in accordance with prevailing public health guidance. The allocation of tests to colleges and universities by the State is an essential pre-requisite for reopening. Status: Complete
The State should enable institutions to have adequate capacity for contact tracing. Status: Complete
The State should provide specific public health guidelines for colleges and universities, covering the wearing of face masks, physical distancing, and the density of dormitories, dining halls, and classrooms. Status: Complete
The State should ensure that adequate supplies of PPE and face masks will be available to colleges and universities. Status: Complete
Adequate surge capacity must be available in nearby health care facilities and hospitals. Status: Complete
UConn (and all other Connecticut institutions) must develop the following plans:
A plan for repopulation of the campus
A plan for monitoring health conditions to detect infection
A plan for containment to prevent spread of the disease when detected
A plan for shutdown in the event it becomes necessary
Status: Complete

ACADEMICS
Here, We're Huskies.
At the University of Connecticut, we unite those who question, challenge, and push what's possible — whether that learning takes place in person on our campuses, online, or a combination of both. We will continue offering flexible modes of course delivery for spring 2020 to enable UConn to continue delivering the same outstanding education to all students while keeping safety at the forefront. The University is carrying out its plans for course delivery and the academic calendar, as well as how the risk of COVID-19 transmission will be minimized in classrooms and common spaces.

Academics and Instruction
Classes are being provided in a range of formats including in-person, online, and a combination of the two formats to allow the University to prioritize both safety and the UConn educational experience. Learn more about the course modalities being offered for spring 2021 on the Provost’s website.
Registration for spring 2021 will follow the planned schedule, starting on Oct. 26 and ending on Nov. 11 for undergraduates.
The modality for each course will be listed at the time of registration. The detail and description of the modality options has been updated, providing more clarity on expectations of course meeting times and format and the proportion of remote learning to in-person learning.
While the University cannot guarantee any particular course selection, faculty and students who prefer a fully online experience will be accommodated. And while the University cannot guarantee any particular course, UConn will work with students to ensure they have courses, online if requested, that support a timely progression towards their major(s) and degree.
Faculty who wish to teach courses exclusively online will be  accommodated.
The capacity of classrooms has been reduced to allow for appropriate social distancing.
Students should be able to take a full course load; the University expects minimal, if any, disruption to most students’ progress to a degree.
Ac
e spring 2021 start and end dates will remain the same as planned, but spring break will be moved later in the semester, to April 11 through 17. 
The first two weeks of all classes will be conducted remotely so all those returning to campuses and the surrounding areas can quarantine at the same time as they start their courses.
Following spring break, residential students will be sent home and the last two weeks of classes, as well as exams, will be conducted remotely for all students.
For fall 2020, students will not return to campus following Thanksgiving break; the remainder of the semester after Thanksgiving will be entirely online to allow for the completion of the required curriculum, which can include any activities that support preparation for exams. There will be no in-person final exams.
Students who are unable to return home and must remain in the residence halls after Thanksgiving will be permitted to stay following a review by the Department of Residential Life. However, for safety reasons, they will not be permitted to leave campus for the Thanksgiving break.
Although the residential calendar was shifted two weeks earlier than originally planned (arriving early, departing early), the period of academic instruction remains the same; tuition rates remain at the levels previously approved by the board.
Pass/Fail
The University Senate approved an extension of the deadlines to add or remove courses as pass/fail and also extended pass/fail availability to undergraduates with fewer than 26 credits and undergraduates on scholastic probation.
Nov. 20, 2020 – Deadline to add or remove fall 2020 courses as Pass/Fail
April 9, 2021 – Deadline to add or remove spring 2021 courses as Pass/Fail
Students may elect a maximum of 12 credits to be distributed over no more than three courses during their entire academic career (note: courses from spring 2020 do not count toward the 12-credit maximum). Changes will require the approval of an advisor.
Device Requirements for Student Success
As the University of Connecticut makes plans to welcome back new and returning Huskies this fall, it will be essential for all students to have access to the proper IT systems, services, and capabilities so that they may interact with instructors and classmates and complete required coursework. Comprehensive guidance is available on the Keep Learning page.

LIVING ON CAMPUS
A Home Away From Home
We are committed to providing as holistic a living experience as possible for our students, while implementing precautions to protect their health. Safety measures include reduced density and a new housing assignment process, earlier move-in and move-out dates, and testing and quarantine protocols.

Off-Campus and Commuter Student Services is available to assist students in securing off-campus housing and to support those students who commute to campus from home.

As always, campus services for students, faculty, and staff are available.

Spring 2021 Housing
Due to COVID-19, UConn will continue under a similar reduced occupancy model of around 50% occupancy for spring 2021. The University is offering robust online course offerings in the spring in addition to in person learning. Spring housing will not be available to students who are enrolled in online-only classes for the spring semester, unless the student lived on campus during the fall 2020 semester.
On Monday, Oct. 5, 2020 students were given access to the spring 2021 Housing Confirmation form, located in your MyHousing account under “Applications." Students interested in living on campus for the spring, regardless of fall housing status, should submit the form by the priority deadline of Nov. 6, 2020.
Students currently living on campus who do not submit the form by Nov. 6 will have their housing canceled for spring 2021 and will be required to move out by Nov. 21. Those who wish to return to housing for the spring semester will have the option to remain in their current assignment and keep their belongings there over winter recess, with the exception of students currently living in Charter Oak Apartments.
In the spring, Charter Oak Apartments will be reserved as a medical quarantine area and thus will not house students permanently for the semester. Any student who currently lives in Charter Oak Apartments and plans to return to campus for the spring will need to choose a new assignment for the spring, and will need to move out completely on Nov. 21.
Any Charter Oak Apartment resident returning for the spring will be part of a priority group in the spring housing selection process and will have the opportunity to choose housing before all other student groups.
Students who submit by Nov. 6 and are approved to live on campus will receive information for participating in an online selection process. Those who submit the form after Nov. 6 and are approved to live on campus will be assigned housing by Residential Life. If approved, you will receive a notification from livingoncampus@uconn.edu.
In the unlikely case that a positive change in the landscape of the virus results in our being able to remain on campus after spring break and through exams, no additional charges will be added to housing and dining costs. Moreover, similar to the fall and last spring, residence life will work with students who have no viable housing options for the remainder of the spring semester after spring break.
If we are unable to continue campus housing up to spring break, pro-rated housing and dining refunds will be provided to students.
For more information, read the Oct. 2 announcement from Residential Life and Spring 2021 Housing FAQs.

Fall 2020 Residential Calendar and Precautionary Quarantine Period
The residential calendar was shifted two weeks earlier than originally planned (arriving early, departing early). Residential students moved in two weeks before the beginning of classes for a period of self-quarantine and were tested upon arrival.
Students who establish residency on campus should plan to remain on campus for the duration of the contract.
Students who are unable to return home and must remain in the residence halls after Thanksgiving will be permitted to stay following a review by the Department of Residential Life. However, for safety reasons, they will not be permitted to leave campus for the Thanksgiving break.
Housing and dining fees remain unchanged. Students who were impacted by the August 11 decision to further reduce housing density on campus will receive refunds on housing and dining fees.
Post-Quarantine Period Guidelines
Students living within the residence halls for the Fall semester must comply with the Temporary Health and Safety Procedures and the Housing Contract. Students are expected to wear a mask or face covering in public; maintain at least six feet of physical distancing and limit time spent closer than six feet apart to less than 15 minutes; and wash their hands often for at least 20 seconds and use hand sanitizer frequently.  Residents will be required to submit to periodic testing for COVID-19. Repeated failure to follow expectations such as masking and physical distancing may result in a referral to Community Standards and/or removal from the residence halls.

HEALTH & SAFETY
The Power of the Pack
It's up to all of us to keep ourselves and each other safe. UConn is moving forward to reopen with the confidence that when we all work together, we can succeed.

UConn's experts are developing comprehensive plans for reopening regarding every aspect of campus. Visit the Department of Environmental Health and Safety's COVID-19 Resources page for a toolkit of information and interactive courses aimed at educating our community on the latest reopening protocols.

Maintaining safety precautions is the responsibility of every employee; faculty and staff are encouraged to politely remind colleagues to adhere to safety protocols if they are not doing so.

Students will be advised on expectations through signage presented throughout the campus. Students will not be able to attend in-person classes or university events if they do not wear a mask and adhere to physical distancing requirements. Repeatedly failing to follow these expectations may result in a referral to Community Standards and/or removal from the residence halls. Following the community expectations is a necessary act of support for all members of UConn Nation.

We will use sound protocols and protective measures to mitigate risk. Here’s how.

Reducing the population of faculty, staff, and students across all campuses whenever possible through:
Reduced classroom, residence hall, and meeting room occupancies
Allowing for continued telecommuting wherever possible
Work crew rotations and flexible schedules
Online education when beneficial to supplement or replace large classroom settings
Limiting large events and visitors on campus
Health screening and monitoring protocols to maintain the wellness of our community, including:
Providing guidelines for student, faculty, and staff testing
Providing protocols for quarantine, self-isolation, and contact tracing.
Strengthening a culture that supports all students, faculty, and staff to “stay home when ill”
Providing ongoing COVID-19 testing resources
Providing resources, when available, for rapid identification, notification, education, and support for positive cases
Reserving residential isolation spaces to reduce transmission
Ensuring individuals coming to campus adhere to state travel advisory guidelines
Education and engagement of the community to maintain a safe campus via:
Mandatory COVID-19 safety training that includes instruction on physical distancing, wearing of face coverings, hand hygiene, and sanitation
Required masking and physical distancing in classrooms and all other common areas and workspaces indoors and outdoors on campus. The University will work with students and employees who are unable to wear a mask to find an effective solution that will ensure the safety of others. The University has procured a sufficient number of masks to distribute to our entire population. Other than those who are unable to wear a traditional mask due to a medical condition, for example, masking in classrooms and other commons spaces is not optional.
Safety signage and regular messaging that is clear and accessible
A community commitment to follow health and safety protocols
COVID-19 safety resources to help workers stay safe
Implementing structural transmission prevention measures, including:
Allowing for physical distancing in classrooms and learning spaces
Creating pedestrian movement patterns through both open and closed spaces
Posting visual cues to assist physical distancing
Establishing touchless point-of-service technology
Enhanced cleaning and hygiene protocols, including:
Frequent cleaning of high-touch surfaces
Hand sanitizer stations made available at the entrances to buildings and classrooms
Providing cleaning/disinfecting supplies for commonly used surfaces
Encouraging personal hand hygiene practices
Update on Masks
In order to ensure the health and safety of the UConn community, all students, faculty, and staff are required to wear face coverings when on campus. The University is providing all students, faculty, and staff with two washable cloth face masks.

Storrs Residential Students: Masks were placed in each residence hall room prior to move-in.

Stamford Residential Students: Masks were distributed by the Campus Director.

Storrs Off-Campus and Commuter Students: The Office of Off-Campus and Commuter Student Services has reached out to property managers near the Storrs Campus.
