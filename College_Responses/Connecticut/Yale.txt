That's why I chose YALE!!!!!!!

Each member of the community plays a critical role in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and keeping Yale healthy.

All students, faculty, and staff must commit to following health and safety guidelines and setting an example for their peers. Because state and public health officials may need to adjust their policies based on the status of COVID-19 spread in our region, the guidelines here may be updated regularly.
Testing Requirements by Community
To help prevent the transmission of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 on campus, the university created the Yale COVID-19 Screening Program for all students, faculty, staff, and trainees who have returned to campus. For testing requirements for different groups, please carefully review these policies:

Undergraduate Students
Testing includes both pre-arrival and at-arrival testing, as well as ongoing screening of asymptomatic individuals during the semester.

The frequency of required testing in this program reflects an analysis of testing protocols that would be most likely to limit the spread of the infection. The program uses an observed, self-administered swab in the front of the nostrils to collect a specimen, which is sent for viral (PCR) testing, the current preferred method for detecting viral infection.

Prior to arrival to campus (New Haven)

All undergraduate students who are enrolled in residence, whether they plan to live on campus or in off-campus housing, are required to have a viral (PCR) test before arriving on campus. Students already in New Haven must also complete this testing requirement. Pre-arrival testing is not available for students arriving from international locations; these students will be tested upon arrival to campus.
If a student’s pre-arrival test is positive, the student should seek medical advice and isolate in their “home” location for at least 10 days and at least 24 hours following resolution of a fever, if present. Students with a positive test should not travel to New Haven but should begin their studies remotely. 
Upon arrival to campus (New Haven)

All undergraduate students who are enrolled in residence, whether living on campus or in off-campus housing, must have a viral (PCR) test on arrival at the beginning of the semester; this test is administered by the university through the Yale COVID-19 Screening Program.
All undergraduate students are required to quarantine in their rooms, suites, or residences until they receive a negative arrival test (~24-36 hours). Additionally:
After receiving a negative arrival test, students living on-campus may leave their rooms or suites but will continue to quarantine for a total of 14 days in their residential college, unless they have delayed arrival until after the end of the two-week campus quarantine period and they are arriving from a state that is not included in the State of Connecticut Travel Advisory.
Students Iiving off-campus and arriving from states included in the State of Connecticut Travel Advisory must quarantine for 14 days in their apartment or home location, and must complete a Connecticut Travel Health Form. Failure to abide by this quarantine could result in a $1,000 fine from the state. Keep in mind that the Connecticut Travel Advisory list is updated regularly.
Ongoing screening

All undergraduate students who are enrolled in residence , whether living on campus or in off-campus housing, must be tested on a twice weekly schedule throughout the semester.
Students who test positive through the university testing program will be referred for contact tracing and will be required to isolate in designated on-campus rooms or in their off-campus residences until released by Yale Health. Medical monitoring and advice will be provided by Yale Health during isolation. See guidance for what to do while isolating:
Fact Sheet for Undergraduates On Campus
Fact Sheet for Undergraduates Off Campus
This testing program is intended to detect infection in asymptomatic individuals and does not replace Yale’s testing and care protocols for individuals who have symptoms of COVID-19. The university will continue to provide testing and care for symptomatic individuals through Yale Health. 

Compliance with testing, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine is a component of the Yale Community Compact, which reflects our strong and shared commitment to promote the health and safety of all community members. All members of our university community must also abide by other public health and safety measures designed to reduce the risk of COVID-19 viral transmission on our campus and in the surrounding New Haven community. These include wearing a face covering, physical distancing, and regular hand washing. Testing is not a substitute for these behavioral measures in containing the spread of the virus.

Prevention
Wearing a mask or face covering and physical distancing are among the most effective ways to prevent transmission of COVID-19. The university is supplying masks and other necessary supplies to all students, faculty, and staff.

All individuals on campus must maintain at least 6 feet of space from others when in public spaces.
All individuals on campus must wear masks or face-coverings when in public spaces. This includes all outside areas on campus even if maintaining at least 6 feet of distance from others.
Masks or face-coverings and physical distancing are not required when people are in their own residential college suite or apartment or alone in an office.
The following health precautions must also be followed:

Avoid contact with people who are ill.
Refrain from touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. (See CDC handwashing video.) Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are unavailable.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.
Stay home if you are ill—do not go to work or classes.
If you need medical attention, stay home and call your provider before going to a health care facility.

Yale COVID-19 Contact Tracing Program
To optimize the safety of the campus environment, Yale has implemented a campus-based contact tracing program.

What Is Contact Tracing?
Contact tracing is an important disease control measure to prevent further spread of COVID-19. This process begins by asking individuals who are diagnosed with COVID-19 about people with whom they had contact while they may have been infectious. These people (‘contacts’) are then notified about their potential exposure without revealing the identity of the person who was diagnosed with COVID-19. Contacts are provided guidance on how to take care of themselves and prevent transmission to others.

What to Expect
To optimize the safety of the campus and community, Yale has implemented a campus-based Contact Tracing Program. Here is what you can expect if you are a member of the Yale community and you test positive for COVID-19.

1. Prior to contact tracing, you will be notified of your test result.

If you are tested by Yale, either at Yale Health or through a campus-based screening program (for staff, students or faculty), you will be notified of the test result and given appropriate clinical guidance. You will also be informed that the Yale Contact Tracing Team will call you for a contact tracing interview. If you are tested outside of Yale, you should call the Campus COVID Resource Line (203-432-6604) to notify them of your test result. Through either of these mechanisms, the Yale Contact Tracing Team will be notified, and a member of the team will call you for a contact tracing interview. You may also call the Campus COVID Resource Line anytime for guidance.

2. Next, the Yale Contact Tracing Team will call you for a contact tracing interview.

Our goal is to call you within 24 hours of your test result. During this interview, you may ask questions, and you will be referred to additional resources as needed. You will be asked about your close contacts during the time you were infectious (2 days prior to symptom onset or 2 days prior to testing if you are asymptomatic). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a close contact is defined as someone who has been within 6 feet of you for 15 minutes for more.

We will ask about people who meet this definition, such as co-workers and other members of the Yale community (staff, faculty, students) with whom you had contact outside of the workplace.
We will also ask about your household contacts or those with whom you share a living space like suitemates or roommates.
We realize that you may also have community-based contacts, meaning contacts beyond the Yale campus. The Yale Contact Tracing Team will ask about your close community-based contacts. These contacts will be notified by the local health department, but we also encourage you to notify any community-based contacts of their potential exposure. Community-based contacts can call their primary care provider or the city’s hotline (2-1-1) if they have questions or concerns. You may also receive a call from your local health department for community-based contact tracing. If you receive such a call, please cooperate with the local health authorities by participating in the interview.
The Yale Contact Tracing Team will also ask about low-risk workplace contacts. These are people who spent a workshift or workday in an enclosed shared workspace with the case during the infectious period but do not meet the definition of a close contact.
3. Finally, close and low-risk contacts who are identified by the index case will be notified by the Yale Contact Tracing Team.

The Yale Contact Tracing Team will notify all close contacts and household contacts within the Yale community. Your identity will not be revealed to any contacts. Information received through the contact tracing program about close contacts of a COVID-19 positive student will not be used to initiate disciplinary proceedings. Close contacts will be encouraged to self-quarantine (stay home and maintain physical distancing) for 14 days after their last exposure. All contacts (close and low-risk) will be asked to monitor symptoms by checking their temperature twice daily and watching for other COVID-19 symptoms such as cough or shortness of breath. All contacts will also be encouraged to get a test for COVID. Students will also receive a daily survey to monitor their symptoms.

The Yale Contact Tracing Team will check-in with all contacts in quarantine at midpoint, and all will receive an email to release them from quarantine.

All contacts within the Yale community will be offered a COVID-19 screening test through Yale’s screening program. Contacts who develop symptoms should promptly isolate themselves and call their primary care provider or the Campus COVID Resource Line (203-432-6604) to schedule a COVID-19 test.

Isolation and Quarantine
An important strategy for reducing transmission of the virus is to identify those with infections and instruct them to isolate while they are infectious. It is also important to identify close contacts of infected individuals and instruct them to quarantine during the time when they might contract the virus as a result of their close exposure.

Isolation
Students
Students who test positive through the university testing program will be referred for contact tracing and will be required to isolate in designated on-campus rooms or in their off-campus residences until released by Yale Health. Medical monitoring and advice will be provided by Yale Health during isolation.

What to Do if You Become Ill
If you experience fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, stay home and contact a healthcare provider for guidance—do not go to a health care facility before you have called your health care provider or a hospital emergency room for instructions. 

If you are a Yale student or Yale Health member, you should contact Internal Medicine (203-432-0038), Student Health (203-432-0312), or Pediatrics (203-432-0206). For nights and weekends, please call Yale Health Acute Care (203-432-0123).
If you are an Aetna member or have other healthcare coverage, please contact your physician.
All members of the Yale community may also contact the Campus COVID Resource Line (203-432-6604).
Avoid contact with others to limit spread. 
Cover your cough/sneeze with a tissue or sleeve, not your hands. Wash your hands with soap and water after coughing, sneezing, and blowing your nose. (See CDC handwashing video.) Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are unavailable.
Wear a face mask or face covering to minimize the risk of spread of infection.
If you are diagnosed with COVID-19 at any time, please call the Campus COVID Resource Line (203-432-6604), so we can initiate contact tracing and other infection control measures.
