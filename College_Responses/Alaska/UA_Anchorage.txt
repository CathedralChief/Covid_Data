In response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, UAA has taken steps to protect the health and safety of our campus community. The fall 2020 semester will occur primarily via alternate course delivery, remote work and controlled access to campus facilities. A mandatory mask policy is in effect at all UAA campuses.
Students can visit the College During COVID website to access support services and valuable resources related to successfully navigating the fall semester. In addition, the UAA COVID-19 website is a great source for information regarding COVID-19 communications, onsite operations, statewide guidance, resources and confirmed COVID-19 cases in UAA facilities.
Please note that the UAA Student Health and Counseling Center remains open at this time to serve UAA students. For information about COVID-19 symptoms and current health recommendations, visit the CDC website and the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services.


Masks are required in all university facilities and in all classrooms. 
View the official UAA mask policy for information about exceptions and accommodations due to medical conditions or job-related hazards that would prevent mask use.

Only students approved to live on campus are permitted to enter residence halls.
Students entering the residential community at the beginning of the semester must have two negative COVID-19 tests. This applies regardless of whether the studentâ€™s point of origin is in state or out of state and prior to attending any face-to- face classes.

Student Health and Counseling Center
The UAA Student Health and Counseling Center (SHCC) is open daily. Director SHCC is keeping abreast of both state and federal guidance on public health issues related to COVID-19.

Athletics
On July 17, the Great Northwest Athletic Conference (GNAC) CEO Board made a unanimous decision to suspend all fall athletic competition until at least Nov. 30 due to the ongoing and increasing risks associated with the pandemic.
Volleyball and cross-country will not compete this fall. The GNAC and all member institutions are exploring the feasibility of moving the fall athletic seasons to spring, including competitions for a post-season championship.

Based on guidance provided by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), international students currently in programs in the U.S. will be allowed to remain in the U.S. Students must maintain their status requirements but are provided an exception for in-person course requirements.
