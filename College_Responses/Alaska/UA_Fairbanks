We’ve been working throughout the spring and summer to create a safe campus environment for students. Things will look and feel different this year, but we are ready to provide the best possible learning experience, continuity in your education and a memorable college experience. Every student has a role in keeping our university community safe, so we are asking all students to step up and do their part to keep Nanook Nation Healthy. Here’s what you can expect:

STUDENT PLEDGE AND TRAINING
Nanooks Care compact and pledge
If you live on campus or are taking in-person classes at any UAF location, you will be asked to sign a pledge committing to follow UAF safety protocols and the five things you can do to keep Nanook Nation healthy: wash your hands, wear a mask, stay 6 feet apart, cover your cough and stay home when you are sick.

Nanooks Care Pledge 
       (for all students taking in-person classes or needing access to UAF facilities)
Nanooks Care Compact 
       (for students living on campus)
Report a COVID concern to the Student Care Team
Training
We have also created a short training with information about COVID-19, how it spreads and how to protect yourself and your community. 

(Training is hosted on Blackboard. UA login required.)

FACE COVERINGS
Face coverings are required on all of our campuses and facilities. If you have some already, bring them with you, but don’t worry if you don’t. All students will get a free reusable face mask. If you live in a residence hall, you’ll get yours when you move in.

While there are some exceptions for people with health issues, wearing face coverings on campus is not something you can opt out of. Refusing to wear one is cause for disciplinary action under the Student Code of Conduct (09.02) (PDF). 

For additional assistance or accommodations, students can contact UAF Disability Services and employees and visitors can contact UA Human Resources to receive guidance or request a reasonable accommodation.

TRAVEL, VERIFICATION LETTER AND ARRIVING AT UAF
If you are coming to Alaska from outside the state or from another country, you will be required to comply with the state’s requirements for out-of-state travelers entering Alaska and are strongly encouraged to get a COVID-19 test within 72 hours of travel to help minimize disruption to your classes at the beginning of the semester.  This applies whether you are living on campus or not. Use our student travel checklist to help you plan. 

You may also need a letter verifying that you are arriving in Alaska for in-person school. This letter will allow you to avoid paying a fee for a test at the airport if you were unable to get a test before you travel. Visit this link to generate your verification letter, which you can then print and save. 

Make sure you check the “Campus Life” section for additional requirements if you are planning to live on campus.

ACADEMICS
UAF will offer a mixture of in-person and distance courses, with many a hybrid of both. Face-to-face courses will have fewer students in the classrooms and labs, with desks and workstations spaced at least six feet apart and supplies available for students to clean their desks before and after use. Custodians will thoroughly clean all teaching spaces every day.

Advising 
The Academic Advising Center is currently closed to in-person visits. Please call 907-474-6396 to set up an advising appointment via phone, Google Hangouts or Zoom.

Bookstore
You can now place your Bookstore order online for curbside pickup! Pickup times are available Monday-Friday, 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Once you’ve scheduled your order online, go to one of the three parking spots set aside at the Wood Center bus stop (3K), call 907-474-6858 and give the customer service representative the last five digits of your online order. For more information, email 1191mgr@follett.com.

Computer labs
Physical distancing will be required in computing labs and other shared study spaces.

Library
See our Library Services Updates page for information about changes to Rasmuson Library Services.

Virtual Campus
UA Virtual Campus has technology tools and tips that make it possible to study when you can’t get to campus.

Zoom resources
Final exams
The UAF final exam schedule for the fall semester has been updated to allow students and instructors more flexibility. While there are three-hour blocks allocated for scheduling each course's final exam, students should expect that their final exam in each class will be no more than two hours long. 

BURSAR’S OFFICE ONLINE SERVICES

CAMPUS LIFE
Housing
Moving into the residence halls will be by appointment this year. In addition, all students who plan to live in residence halls will be required to have a COVID-19 test within 72 hours prior to or immediately upon arrival, followed by a second test 7-14 days later. Getting tested before you arrive will minimize disruption to your education at the start of the semester because students will be required to self-quarantine in their room or apartment until they receive their first negative COVID-19 test. Residence Life will arrange for food delivery for quarantined students. 

Students are highly encouraged to submit their result to SHCC Patient Portal prior to checking into their room/apartment.

Visit the UAF Residence Life COVID-19 guidance page for important communications regarding living on campus for the fall 2020 semester, including the fall 2020 move-in guide.

Dining
Our main dining facilities will be open, but will operate differently. Expect limited seating and more grab-and-go and take-out options. Visit the Dining Services website for information about safety measures, locations and hours, changes in services and seating guidelines. 

The Pub
The Pub is working toward being able to open in some capacity, although hours and programs will change. 

Nanook Recreation
The SRC, Outdoor Adventures rental center, Patty Pool and locker rooms are currently open, but have reduced capacity. Visit the Nanook Recreation website prior to visiting to review facility hours and safety measures.

Activities and socializing
Socializing will be very different this academic year, but most of us have been learning how to be together while apart since the spring. Social distancing remains an important tool in slowing the spread of COVID-19. That’s not limited to keeping 6 feet of physical distance from other people. It means keeping your social circles small and consistent and avoiding large gatherings of people. It means meeting virtually when possible and limiting the number of times you visit public places. The UAF Center for Student Engagement will sponsor activities on campus with safety in mind and Student Leadership and Involvement will help student organizations fulfill their missions with the same thing in mind. The Nanook Diversity and Action Center will continue to provide programs that focus on diversity, inclusion, caring and wellness. 

Visitors and guests
Outside guests will not be allowed in residence halls. The only people who will be allowed to visit students in their residence halls are other students who live in campus housing. 

Other visitors to campus are subject to UA guidance on campus entry.

HEALTH CARE, SCREENINGS AND REPORTING
Daily self-screening
Students should assess their health daily prior to attending classes or visiting other shared spaces in campus facilities. COVID-19 symptoms can be very mild. If you feel even slightly ill, stay home. If you live in a residence hall or apartment, stay in your room or apartment and contact Residence Life by phone at 907-474-7247 for assistance.

If you are ill
Call the Student Health and Counseling Center  at 907-474-7043 for an appointment. You will be screened over the phone for recent travel and other symptoms such as fever, cough and/or shortness of breath. Medical providers will be able to give proper guidance on next steps during this telephone screening time. For information about hours, access and services, visit the SHCC website. 

Reporting illness
If you are enrolled in face-to-face classes or live in residence halls, report your illness to Environmental Health, Safety, and Risk Management via the student COVID-19 reporting form. 

In addition, students living in campus housing are required to immediately call Residence Life at 907-474-7247 if they are symptomatic, under investigation for COVID-19 or test positive for COVID-19.

Contact tracing at UAF
“Contact tracing” refers to the process of identifying people who were in contact with a person who has COVID-19. Learn more about UAF's new contact tracing procedure.

Mental health and counseling
The Student Health and Counseling Center is providing telehealth services via SecureVideo. Please call 907-474-7043 to schedule an appointment. As your appointment day gets closer, you will receive an email with instructions on how to access the video session.

The SHCC is also hosting the Wednesday Group, an eight-week open group for students to connect, socialize and support mental wellness.
