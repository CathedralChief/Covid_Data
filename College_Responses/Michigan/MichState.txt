Keeping Spartans Safe

To slow the spread of COVID-19, Michigan State University is directing everyone to take personal responsibility to protect their own health and safety, as well as the health and safety of MSU faculty, staff, students, visitors and loved ones. 

As part of that responsibility, all employees and students must fill out the health screening form before coming to campus (students living on campus must fill it out daily as well). Additionally, MSU is strongly recommending that all students living off campus in East Lansing or the surrounding communities also complete the health screening form every day, even if they will not be on campus that day. You will be directed as to whether it is safe for you to come on campus.  

Face coverings

Wearing a face covering, whether you feel ill or have been diagnosed with COVID-19, is critical to maintaining everyone’s health and safety.

Face coverings must be worn by everyone (including all faculty, staff, students, alumni, vendors and visitors) indoors and outdoors while you are on property owned or governed by MSU and while participating in MSU-related or MSU-sponsored activities. If you have a medical condition that may prevent you from safely wearing a face covering, or you would like a clear face covering, you should contact MSU’s Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities to begin the accommodation process. Exceptions to the requirement for face coverings will be limited. Read the full directive, including information on compliance and enforcement, on coverings here.
Practice physical distancing

Keep at least six feet of separation between yourself and others when possible. You must avoid large gatherings and crowded events that exceed the State of Michigan’s gathering guidelines, abide by mandated event and business closures and minimize close contact with people from outside your household as well as those who may be sick or are exhibiting flu-like symptoms.
Practice good personal hygiene

Wash hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, blowing your nose, coughing and before eating. If soap and water is not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects, such as doorknobs, tables, light switches, phones, keyboards and faucets. Clean your personal spaces and workspaces regularly with soap followed by using an approved household disinfectant.
Self-monitoring

People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:

    Fever or chills
    Cough
    Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
    Fatigue
    Muscle or body aches
    Headache
    New loss of taste or smell
    Sore throat
    Congestion or runny nose
    Nausea or vomiting
    Diarrhea

This list does not include all possible symptoms. The CDC will continue to update this list as they learn more about COVID-19.
Prevention

There is no vaccine currently. To protect yourself and others, follow everyday preventive actions including:

    Avoid close contact with people, especially those who are sick
    Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands
    Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, blowing your nose, coughing, and before eating (If soap and water is not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol)
    Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects such as doorknobs
    Stay home if you are sick
    Wear a face covering in public

MSU COVID-19 Early Detection Program

The COVID-19 Early Detection Program is a key part of MSU's health and safety strategy. This initiative will help MSU identify the possible presence of the virus in people who are asymptomatic. By analyzing saliva samples throughout the semester, officials will be able to better monitor and manage infections on campus before outbreaks might occur. The program is currently paused to instead focus on departure screening and testing for students leaving for fall break. Students who are interested in the departure program should register using this link.

For the spring semester, MSU will require participation in the COVID-19 Early Detection Program for students living on campus and undergraduate students coming to campus during the spring semester due to, for example, in-person classes, labs or work.

The Michigan State University Community Compact applies to MSU students, faculty, staff, alumni, contractors, vendors and visitors. In return for being part of the MSU community, by this Compact, I am taking personal responsibility in order to protect the health and safety of myself and others. My actions will impact everyone. 

The novel coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19, has been declared a worldwide pandemic. The COVID-19 virus is extremely contagious and is believed to spread mainly from person-to-person contact. There is no guarantee that I or others on campus will not become infected by COVID-19. I acknowledge the risks of COVID-19 and returning to campus, and I acknowledge that I will do my part to protect myself and others.  

Accordingly, as a member of the MSU community, I agree that I will follow these requirements until MSU instructs me otherwise while on the property owned or governed by MSU and while participating in MSU-related or sponsored activities, wherever they may occur:
Requirements

Face Coverings

I will wear an appropriate face covering over my nose and mouth while I am on MSU property, both indoors and outdoors, unless I am unable to tolerate a face covering for medical reasons.    

Physical Distancing

I will maintain 6 feet of distance between myself and others with whom I do not live, to the maximum extent possible.

Personal Hygiene

I will maintain proper hygiene and health practices, including:

    Washing my hands frequently with soap and water or, if soap is unavailable, using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol
    Routinely cleaning and sanitizing my living space and/or workspace
    Using the bend of my elbow or shoulder to shield a cough or sneeze
    Refraining from shaking hands

Adherence to Signage and Instructions

To protect myself and others, I will (a) look for instructional signs posted by MSU or public health authorities, (b) observe instructions from MSU or public health authorities that are emailed to my “msu.edu” account, and (c) follow those instructions.

Self-Monitoring

I will monitor myself for flu-like symptoms (for example, cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, fever, sore throat or loss of taste or smell). If I experience any flu-like symptoms, I will stay at my place of residence and contact a health care provider to determine what steps should be taken.

Exposure to COVID-19

If I have been exposed to someone who is ill or has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus, I will stay at my place of residence, contact a health care provider and follow all public health recommendations. 

Adherence to Public Health Guidance and Cooperation with Public Health Authorities

I will follow all applicable state and public health guidance, and I will cooperate with public health authorities, including, but not limited to, contact tracing. Further, I have been encouraged by MSU to (a) participate in COVID-19 surveillance and screening, (b) participate in COVID-19 testing, and (c) receive a flu vaccination this fall. 

Additional information on these requirements can be found here.
Compact Compliance

Protecting the health and safety of MSU students, faculty, staff and visitors requires the cooperation of all members of the community, not only through personal compliance with the Compact, but to encourage others to comply. 

Concerns about noncompliance can be made anonymously to the MSU Misconduct Hotline at 800-763-0764 or misconduct.msu.edu. Compact compliance concerns reported via the online hotline should be submitted under the "Health & Safety" section.  

Persons who violate the Compact will be subject to disciplinary action in the same manner and magnitude as violations of other university policies.

Students

Residence Education and Housing Services staff and Student Life staff are expected to educate students regarding the Compact and to promote compliance with it. 

Faculty and Staff

University leaders, managers, supervisors and facilities managers are expected to educate employees regarding the Compact and to promote compliance in their areas of responsibility as well as on the larger campus.
