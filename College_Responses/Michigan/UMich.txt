Students, faculty and staff on the Ann Arbor campus, including Michigan Medicine, who have tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 90 days outside of U-M - that is, outside University Health Service (UHS), Occupational Health Services (OHS) or the Community Sampling and Tracking Program (CSTP) - are asked to report their positive test result here.

The information collected will be directed to appropriate units for follow up including: University Health Service; Environment, Health & Safety; Occupational Health Services; and/or Infection Prevention & Epidemiology. University or county health officials may reach out for case investigation and contact tracing, and the information gathered will help target resources for testing, support and mitigation.

While physical distancing, wearing a face covering and hand washing are the most reliable actions we can take to protect our community, testing is an additional intervention in the "layered approach" to preventing COVID-19.

The University of Michigan is using a multi-tiered testing and monitoring strategy to help stop the spread of the virus on campus. It was developed based on the detailed guidance of dozens of experts including several faculty members from the School of Public Health who also advise Michigan’s Governor Gretchen Whitmer. It includes:

The U-M COVID-19 Community Sampling and Tracking program, a free, opt-in, voluntary surveillance asymptomatic testing program open to students living on or off campus as well as faculty and staff, including those from Michigan Medicine, who work in -person on the Ann Arbor campus.

U-M is offering departure testing and guidance for students prior to returning to their permanent residences and surrounding communities.

ResponsiBLUE is a mobile app and accessible, mobile-friendly website (responsiblue.umich.edu) that will help faculty, staff, and students keep the university healthy and reduce the spread of COVID-19.

Each day, all members of our campus community who enter campus buildings and facilities are required to check themselves for COVID-19 symptoms by answering a brief set of questions using ResponsiBLUE. The tool offers advice on where to seek care if you are not well and provides insights and visibility to the state of public health at U-M.

To sign in to ResponsiBLUE, go to ResponsiBLUE.umich.edu and enter your UMICH (Level-1) Weblogin and/or choose your uniqname@umich.edu account.

See detailed instructions about ResponsiBLUE Sign-in for Michigan Medicine.

Every university community member studying or working at home or remotely can also use ResponsiBLUE. While it is not required of individuals who are remote, doing so will help make using the tool a healthy habit, and the aggregated data gathered will provide useful information about the overall health of the U-M community.

Visitors and vendors must use the guest version of ResponsiBLUE (guest.responsiblue.umich.edu) whenever they come to campus. Or scan the QR code below.

Once an individual has logged in, the screening tool will ask three yes or no questions based on CDC and other public-health guidance related to COVID-19 symptoms and contact with others. Based on the responses, individuals will either see a green screen with a check mark, indicating they can enter U-M buildings (results expire after 18 hours), or a red screen, indicating that they should take specific actions based on university guidelines and the directions on the red screen.

Screening results expire after 18 hours.

The tool will be updated and enhanced over time to include additional features that assist the community in making health-informed choices that help keep the U-M community as safe as possible during the pandemic.

This app was developed by U-M Information and Technology Services in partnership with the Office of Research and University of Michigan leadership.
Wolverine Culture of Care

To provide the best campus experience possible in the context of this historic threat to the health and well-being of all, we understand that consistently making safe and healthy choices to keep the entire community as safe as possible is a collective responsibility shared by students, faculty, staff and Ann Arbor residents. As such, Wolverines are committed to care for ourselves and to be respectful of our impact on the health of others, by committing to the following:
Monitor, Self-Isolate & Participate

Protect the community through vigilant self-monitoring for symptoms and self-isolate if/when symptoms do develop or you are in contact with someone with symptoms. Avoid and/or minimize travel and the hosting of guests throughout the semester. Participate in testing, isolation/quarantine and contact tracing as suggested by health care providers and required by public health officials.

Promote Holistic Well-Being

Observe and integrate all dimensions of well-being important to a thriving community: Physical, Emotional/ Mental, Environmental, Financial, Occupational, Social, Intellectual and Spiritual.

Concern Reporting Student Registry

All students living off-campus are asked to opt in to a voluntary address registry, providing the university with their name, address and cell contact information.

By signing up for the opt-in registry, students receive updates from the COVID-19 concern reporting line if a concern about their address surfaces, giving them the opportunity to address the situation without police involvement as the first response.

Being able to text or call a responsible student as an initial level of peer outreach may prevent the need for law enforcement interactions.

Education modules

All U-M students (undergraduates and graduates) are required to take an online course called “Staying Healthy in a Changing Environment for Students on Campus.” The course provides students with information about the COVID-19 virus, mental well-being, and returning to campus. Students will learn important information, critical skills and how to access resources.

The course lasts 25 minutes. Students received an email from campus leaders during the beginning of the Fall semester informing them about how to complete the course.

At the end of the course, off-campus students are asked to voluntarily opt in to provide their current off campus address and cell number to allow for students to be directly contacted about any concerns related to their residence.

If you’ve haven’t completed the course, please visit the First Year Experience course page for more information.
Employees

All employees working on campus are required to take COVID-19 training that at a minimum covers the following:

    Workplace infection controls practices.
    The proper use of personal protective equipment.
    Steps the employee must take to notify the university of any symptoms of COVID-19 or a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.
    How to report unsafe working conditions.

Here are two training modules available in My LINC:

    COVID-19: Working Safely at U-M.
    COVID-19: Working Safely in U-M Research Areas.

Documentation that employees have taken this training is required, and will be maintained in the system. Departments should also ensure that individuals are trained on their site-specific workplace requirements.

Together, we will make a difference

Physical distancing, wearing a face covering and hand washing are the most reliable actions we can take to protect our community.

    Maintain a physical distance of 6 feet or more between yourself and others.
    Wear a face covering that covers your mouth, nose and chin anywhere on campus including indoors, outside and on U-M transportation.
    Wash your hands frequently with soap and warm water for 20 seconds. If unable to wash your hands, use hand sanitizer.
    Cover your coughs and sneezes. Avoid touching your face.
    If you're gathering with others, meet outdoors when possible and limit the size. The smaller the group, the safer the event.
    Do not share common food and beverages.
    If you feel sick, stay home and away from others. Seek medical attention if necessary.
    Get vaccinated against the flu.
